title: CD20 antibodies and uses thereof
abstract: CD20 is a transmembrane protein of the tetra-spanin family expressed on the surface of B-cells from peripheral blood as well as lymphoid tissues. CD20 expression persists from the early pre-B cell stage until the plasma cell differentiation stage. In addition to expression in normal B-cells, CD20 is expressed in B-cell derived malignancies such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The present invention includes anti-CD20 antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof comprising a light chain variable region and a heavy chain variable region, wherein the CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3 of said light chain variable region comprise the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 17-19, respectively, and wherein the CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3 of said heavy chain variable region comprise the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 20-22, respectively.

CD20 and CD20 isoforms CD20 are generally appreciated to be transmembrane proteins of the tetra spanin family that are expressed on the surface of B cells Valentine et al. J. Biol. Chem. 264 19 11282 11287 1989 Einfeld et al. EMBO J. 7 3 711 717 1988 . CD20 is expressed by the vast majority of peripheral blood B cells as well as B cells from various lymphoid tissues. CD20 expression generally persists from the early pre B cell stage of development until the plasma cell differentiation stage of development Tedder et al. J. Immunol. 135 2 973 979 1985 . CD20 is not generally expressed by hematopoietic stem cells pro B cells differentiated plasma cells or non lymphoid tissues or the like. In addition to expression in normal B cells CD20 is expressed in B cell derived malignancies such as non Hodgkin s lymphoma NHL and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL Anderson et al. Blood 63 6 1424 1433 1984 and B cells involved in immune disorders autoimmune disease and inflammatory diseases.

Although the exact function of CD20 is unclear CD20 is implicated in calcium mobilization and may function as a calcium channel Tedder et al. 14D 195 1990 . CD20 might be involved in the activation and differentiation of B cells Tedder et al. 16 8 881 887 1986 .

The expression profile of CD20 and knowledge of existing CD20 antibodies has made CD20a target of interest for antibody therapies. It is known in the art that generally antibodies for CD20 are classified based on their functional properties. For example Type I antibodies are characterized by their ability to distribute CD20 into lipid raft compartments and when chimerized can mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC Deans J P J Biol Chem 1998 273 344 8 Cragg M S Blood 2003 101 1045 52 and Cragg M S Blood. 2004 103 2738 2743 . Type I antibodies typically do not have effective pro apoptotic activity on their own unless the antibodies are cross linked. Examples of Type I antibodies requiring cross linking are rituximab and 2F2 Cragg et al. 101 3 1045 1052 2003 and Teeling et al. 104 6 1793 1800 2004 . In contrast Type II antibodies are unable to distribute CD20 into lipid rafts. If chimerized Type II antibodies have limited CDC activity. Type II antibodies are characterized by their strong pro apoptotic activity. B1 and GA101 are examples of Type II antibodies Cragg M S Blood 2003 101 1045 52 Cragg M S Blood. 2004 103 2738 2743 and Umana et al. 108 72a Abstract 229 2006 . Type I and Type II antibodies can potentially mediate antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC .

Given the expression of CD20 by unwanted cells such as in B cell lymphomas this antigen is useful for targeting harmful CD20 positive cells e.g. lymphoma cells . In essence such targeting is generalized as follows antibodies specific to CD20 surface antigen of B cells are administered to a patient. These anti CD20 antibodies specifically bind to the CD20 antigen of both normal and unwanted e.g. malignant and immunoreactive B cells the antibody bound to the CD20 surface antigen may lead to the destruction and depletion of the B cells.

Additionally chemical agents or radioactive labels having the potential to destroy CD20 expressing tumor cells can be conjugated to the anti CD20 antibody such that the agent is specifically delivered to the neoplastic B cells. Irrespective of the approach a primary goal is to destroy the unwanted cells the specific approach can be determined by the particular anti CD20 antibody that is utilized and thus the available approaches to targeting the CD20 antigen can vary considerably. The rituximab RITUXAN antibody is a genetically engineered chimeric murine human monoclonal antibody directed against CD20. Rituximab is the antibody called C2B8 in U.S. Pat. No. 5 736 137 Anderson et al. . Rituximab is currently approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma Leget et al. 10 548 551 1998 . Reports indicate that with weekly infusions rituximab resulted in overall response rates of 48 . However many patients do not respond to rituximab treatment and responding patients taking rituximab eventually relapse and often develop resistance to rituximab treatment. Relapse and resistance for example to currently available therapies necessitate discovery of new CD20 directed agents and therapies.

Because of the limitations of available antibodies there are next generation antibody therapeutics for CD20 in development which aim to improve specific functional aspects of rituximab. For example in the case of ofatumumab a human monoclonal 2F2 antibody improved in vitro CDC activity has been reported especially in cells having lower CD20 antigen density Teeling et al. 177 1 362 371 2006 . Afutuzumab or GA101 has been reported to have marginal improvement of pro apoptotic activity over rituximab in vitro but GA101 fails to demonstrate CDC activity Umana P Blood 2006 108 72a Abstract 229 and WO 2005 044859 . In addition GA101 is a glycoengineered humanized antibody with improved ADCC activity Umana et al. Blood 2006 108 72a Abstract 229 and WO 2005 044859 . Other compounds in varying stages of development have been reported to marginally improve certain intrinsic properties of rituximab or other known anti CD20 antibodies. However until now no novel molecule having unique physical and functional features addressing the problems known in the art was available.

Rituximab has also been approved in the United States in combination with MTX to reduce signs and symptoms in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to at least one TNF antagonist. Many studies address the use of rituximab in a variety of non malignant autoimmune or inflammatory disorders including RA in which B cells and autoantibodies appear to play a role in disease pathophysiology. Edwards et al. Biochem Soc. Trans. 30 824 828 2002 . Targeting of CD20 using anti CD20 antibody has been reported to potentially relieve signs and symptoms of for example RA Leandro et al. Ann.

Also see Specks et al. Response of Wegener s granulomatosis to anti CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody therapy Arthritis Rheumatism 44 12 2836 2840 2001 which disclosed use of four infusions of 375 mg mof anti CD20 antibody and high dose glucocorticoids to treat Wegener s granulomatosis. The therapy was repeated after 11 months when the cANCA recurred but therapy was without glucocorticoids. At eight months after the second course of anti CD20 antibody the patients disease remained in complete remission. In another study remission of severe ANCA associated vasculitis was reported when anti CD20 antibody was used in a dose of 375 mg m 4 along with oral prednisone at 1 mg kg day which was reduced to 40 mg day by week four and to total discontinuation over the following 16 weeks. Four patients were re treated with anti CD20 antibody alone for recurring rising ANCA titers. Keogh et al. Kidney Blood Press. Res. 26 293 2003 reported that eleven patients with refractory ANCA associated vasculitis went into remission upon treatment with four weekly 375 mg mdoses of anti CD20 antibody and high dose glucocorticoids.

Patients with refractory ANCA associated vasculitis were administered anti CD20 antibody along with immunosuppressive medicaments such as intravenous cyclophosphamide mycophenolate mofetil azathioprine or leflunomide.

Antibody cytotoxic agent conjugates or ACC also called antibody drug conjugates ADC are known to be a type of immunoconjugate that consists of cytotoxic agent covalently linked to an antibody through specialized chemical linker. The use of ACCs for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer see Syrigos and Epenetos 1999 Anticancer Research 19 605 614 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 1997 Adv. Drg Del. Rev. 26 151 172 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. 1986 Lancet pp. Mar. 15 1986 603 05 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in Monoclonal Antibodies 84 Biological And Clinical Applications A. Pinchera et al. ed.s pp. 475 506 . Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have sometimes been reported as being useful in this regard. See Rowland et al. 1986 Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 21 183 87 . Drugs that are known to be used in this regard include daunomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine Rowland et al. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 21 183 87 1986 . Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin. Kerr et al 1997 Bioconjugate Chem. 8 6 781 784 Mandler et al 2000 Journal of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al 2000 Bioorganic Med. Chem.

USA 93 8618 8623 and calicheamicin Lode et al 1998 Cancer Res. 58 2928 Hinman et al 1993 Cancer Res. 53 3336 3342. Toxins may exert cytotoxic and or cytostatic effects through diverse mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Meyer D. L. and Senter P. D. Recent Advances in Antibody Drug Conjugates for Cancer Therapy in Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry Vol 38 2003 Chapter 23 229 237. But many cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are composed of a monoclonal antibody that targets an antigen expressed on the surface of cells and a maytansine derived compound e.g. potent anti mitotic drugs that inhibit microtubule polymerization covalently linked to the antibody. Chari R V Acc. Chem. Res. 2008 January 41 1 98 107. With an appropriate linker an antibody maytansinoid conjugate AMC can be stable in vivo and significantly less toxic for cells that do not express the target antigen thereby increasing the therapeutic index of the conjugate. Upon binding to the target antigen on the cell surface an AMC is internalized broken down in the lysosome presumably by proteases generating active maytansinoid metabolites which then bind and inhibit microtubules thereby triggering cell cycle arrest and ultimately cell death likely by apoptosis. Erickson et al Cancer Res. 2006 Apr. 15 66 8 4426 33. With maytansinoid conjugation mAbs can improve targeted killing activity in vitro and in vivo.

Currently numerous ACCs are being studied in clinical testing and pre clinical development. Ideally immunoconjugates could be easily administered to patients similar to antibody therapies. One ACC in particular called trastuzumab SMCC DM1 T DM1 has been reported to be effective in HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer patients that have failed trastuzumab and chemotherapy while also showing a favourable low toxicity profile. See Vogel C L ASCO 2009 Abstract 1017.

Plasma clearance of antibody maytansinoid conjugates such as trastuzumab SMCC DM1 synthesized with the non cleavable linker SMCC is very slow vis vis the clearance of antibody alone. US2005 0169933. This is in sharp contrast to plasma clearance of conjugates prepared with relatively labile disulfide bonds such as huC242 SPP DM1. For example the half life for clearance of the SMCC conjugate is approximately 320 hours while the half life for the SPP conjugate is in the range of about 40 to 50 hours. However the clearance of the antibody component for each type of conjugate is identical suggesting that the difference in measured conjugate clearance rate could be due to the loss of maytansinoid from the antibody conjugate i.e. in the case of the SPP DM1 conjugate . The non cleavable SMCC linkage has perhaps much more resistant maytansinoid linker cleavage activities in vivo than the SPP DM1 conjugate. Further the decreased clearance rate for the SMCC linker conjugates compared to SPP DM1 conjugates leads to a nearly 5 fold increase in overall maytansinoid exposure of the animal as measure by the area under the curve AuC . This increased exposure could have a substantial impact on drug efficacy.

It has been reported that maytansinoid conjugates prepared with non cleavable linkers such as SMCC show an unexpected increased tolerability in mice compared with conjugates prepared with cleavable disulfide linkers. US2005 0169933. For example the tolerability of huC242 SMCC DM1 and huC242 SPP DM1 conjugates were compared in an acute toxicity test employing a single intravenous dose in CD 1 mice. The maximum tolerated dose MTD for the SMCC DM1 conjugate was greater than the highest dose tested 150 mg kg while the MTD for the disulfide linker conjugate SPP DM1 was in the range of 45 90 mg kg. At 150 mg kg all mice in the SMCC DM1 treated group survived while lethal toxicity was observed for all mice in the SPP DM1 treated group by 96 hours post treatment. Additionally the non reducible thioether linked antibody maytansinoid conjugate trastuzumab SMCC DM1 displayed 2 to 3 fold better tolerability in rats than the cleavable disulfide linked trastuzumab SPP DM1. Lewis Phillips G D Li G Dugger D L et al. Targeting HER2 positive breast cancer with trastuzumab DM1 an antibody cytotoxic drug conjugate Cancer Res 2008 68 9280 90. Therefore it is possible that antibody drug conjugates prepared with non cleavable linkers such as SMCC may exhibit favorable toxicity and pharmacokinetic parameters in preclinical models.

Although CD20 is known in the art CD20 is not a favorable target for antibody drug conjugation since known anti CD20 antibodies are very poorly internalized. Press O W Cancer Res. 1989 49 4906 12 and Vangeepuram N Cancer 1997 80 Suppl. 2425 30. Conjugates of CD20 antibodies have been studied previously but have not demonstrated significantly strong potency especially when non disulfide or acid stable linkers are used.

For example it has been reported that non cleavable SMCC DM1 conjugates of an anti CD20 antibody had the same efficacy as unconjugated antibody while only a cleavable SPP DM1 conjugate of the same antibody showed marginally improved efficacy in a Granta 519 xenograft model in SCID mice. Polson et al. 69 6 2358 2364 2009 . Similarly it has been reported that calicheamicin conjugates of anti CD20 antibody made with an acid stable amide linker did not show improved in vivo efficacy over rituximab in a Ramos xenograft model in nude mice. Only calicheamicin conjugates of rituximab made with an acid labile dimethyl hydrazide Ac But linker showed improved in vivo efficacy in this study. DiJoseph et al. 56 7 1107 1117 2007 . In a different study it was reported that acid labile adriamycin conjugates of an anti CD20 antibody were only moderately effective against a Daudi xenograft model. Acid stable adriamycin conjugates of the same antibody were shown to be completely ineffective. Braslawsky et al. 33 367 74 1991 . Rituximab conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E MMAE via an enzyme cleavable peptide linkage as rituximab vcMMAE reportedly showed in vitro and in vivo efficacy against Ramos lymphoma cells. Law et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 10 23 7842 7851 2004 in Clin. Cancer Res. 11 10 3969 2005 .

Another reported approach at improving the ability of monoclonal antibodies to be effective in the treatment of B cell disorders has been to conjugate a radioactive label to the antibody such that the label is localized at the antigen site. The CD20 targeted radio immunoconjugates Bexxar 131I tositumomab and Zevalin 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan have been approved for relapsed or refractory non Hodgkin s B cell lymphoma patients including patients refractory to rituximab. In a clinical setting some rituximab refractory patients responded to Bexxar . Horning J. Clin. Oncol. 2005 23 712 9. When Zevalin and rituximab were compared in relapsed or refractory low grade or follicular NHL Zevalin treatment reportedly showed significantly better overall and complete response rates than rituximab treatment. Witzig J Clin Oncol 2002 20 2453 2463. While these clinical data suggest that anti CD20 radio immunoconjugates can be more effective than rituximab they are not widely used because of additional toxicities and difficulty in administration associated with using radioactive compounds. Thus there has been a need to develop effective anti CD20 antibodies and conjugates that are easy to administer and have lower toxicity.

Thus there continues to be a need for the development of improved and superior CD20 targeted therapeutic agents including antibodies or antibody fragments that exhibit specificity reduced toxicity stability and enhanced physical and functional properties over known therapeutic agents. The instant invention addresses those needs.

As used herein the term CD20 or CD20 antigen refers to polypeptides and any variants isoforms and species homologs of CD20 that are naturally expressed or are expressed on cells transfected with the CD20 gene or the like. Human CD20 is also known as MS4A1 the membrane spanning 4 domains subfamily A member 1. Additional synonyms for CD20 as recognized in the art include CD20 antigen CD20 receptor B lymphocyte surface antigen B1 B1 Bp35 LEU 16 MGC3969 MS4A2 and S7. Two transcript variants have been described for human CD20. Variant 1 represents a longer transcript variant and corresponds to GenBank ID GI 68348720. Variant 3 lacks a portion of the 5 UTR compared to variant 1 and corresponds to GenBank ID GI 68348721. Variants 1 and 3 encode the same protein. The major form of human CD20 comprises a 297 amino acid protein described by GenBank Protein ID 23110989.

The term epitope refers to a protein determinant capable of specific binding to an antibody. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics.

The term raft refers to the sphingolipid and cholesterol rich membrane microdomains located in the outer leaflet area of the plasma membrane of a cell. The ability of certain proteins to associate within such domains can affect the protein s function. For example the translocation of CD20 molecules into lipid rafts after being bound by the antibodies and or fragments thereof of the present invention creates a high density of CD20 antigen antibody complex in the plasma membranes. Such a high density of CD20 antigen antibody complexes can enable efficient activation of the complement system during CDC.

As used herein an antibody or fragment and the like includes any protein or peptide containing molecule that comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin molecule such as but not limited to at least one complementarity determining region CDR of a heavy or light chain or a ligand binding portion thereof a heavy chain or light chain variable region a heavy chain or light chain constant region a framework region or any portion thereof or at least one portion of an antigen or antigen receptor or binding protein which can be incorporated into an antibody to CD20 of the present invention. Such antibody optionally further affects a specific ligand such as but not limited to where such antibody modulates decreases increases antagonizes agonizes mitigates alleviates blocks inhibits abrogates and or interferes with at least one antigen activity or binding or with antigen receptor activity or binding in vitro in situ in vivo and ex vivo. As a non limiting example various CD20 specific antibodies are disclosed wherein a specified portion or variant can bind at least one antigen molecule or specified portions variants or domains thereof. A suitable antigen specific antibody specified portion or variant can also optionally affect at least one activity or function such as but not limited to RNA DNA or protein synthesis release receptor signaling membrane association binding activity protein production and or synthesis.

Antibodies are heterotetrameric glycoproteins composed of two identical light chains LC and two identical heavy chains HC . Typically each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain VH followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end VL and a constant domain at its other end the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Antibody light chains of any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types namely kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Immunoglobulins can be assigned to five major classes namely IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM depending on the heavy chain constant domain amino acid sequence. IgA and IgG are further sub classified as the isotypes IgA1 IgA2 IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4.

Antibody fragments include any protein or peptide containing molecule that comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin molecule such as but not limited to at least one complementarity determining region CDR of a heavy or light chain or a ligand binding portion thereof a heavy chain or light chain variable region a heavy chain or light chain constant region a framework region or any portion thereof or at least one portion of an antigen or antigen receptor or binding protein which can be incorporated into an antibody to CD20 of the present invention.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions CDRs or hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a beta sheet configuration connected by three CDRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the beta sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest Fifth Edition National Institute of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

The term antibody also includes digestion fragments specified portions and variants thereof including antibody mimetics or comprising portions of antibodies that mimic the structure and or function of an antibody or specified fragment or portion thereof including single chain antibodies and fragments thereof. Functional fragments include antigen binding fragments that bind to a mammalian antigens such as CD20 alone or in combination with other antigens such as for example human epidermal growth factor receptor HER1 IgE vascular endothelial growth factor HER dimerization inhibitors Bcl 2 family proteins MET IL 13 IFN alpha EGFL7 CD40 DR4 and DR5 PI3 kinase lymphotoxin alpha beta 7 integrin amyloid beta CRIg TNF complement C5 CBL CD147 IL 8 gp120 VLA 4 CD11a CD18 VEGF CD40L Id ICAM 1 CD2 EGFR TGF beta TNF alpha E selectin Fact VII TNF Her2 neu F gp CD11 18 CD14 ICAM 3 CD80 CD40L CD4 CD23 beta2 integrin alpha4beta7 CD52 HLA DR CD22 CD64 FcR TCR alpha beta CD2 CD3 Hep B CA 125 EpCAM gp120 CMV gpIIbIIIa IgE IL5 IL 4 CD25 CD3 CD33 CD19 CD22 CD28 CD36 CD37 CD44 CD55 CD59 CD70 CD79 CD80 CD103 CD134 CD137 CD138 CD152 CD30 HLA VNRintegrin CD25 IL 23 and IL 12. For example antibody fragments capable of binding to antigen or portions thereof include but are not limited to Fab e.g. by papain digestion Fab e.g. by pepsin digestion and partial reduction and F ab 2 e.g. by pepsin digestion facb e.g. by plasmin digestion pFc e.g. by pepsin or plasmin digestion Fd e.g. by pepsin digestion partial reduction and reaggregation Fv or scFv e.g. by molecular biology techniques fragments are encompassed by the present invention see e.g. Colligan Immunology .

Such fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage synthetic or recombinant techniques as known in the art and or as described herein. Antibodies can also be produced in a variety of truncated forms using antibody genes in which one or more stop codons have been introduced upstream of the natural stop site. For example a combination gene encoding a F ab 2 heavy chain portion can be designed to include DNA sequences encoding the CH1 domain and or hinge region of the heavy chain. The various portions of antibodies can be joined together chemically by conventional techniques or can be prepared as a contiguous protein using genetic engineering techniques.

 Blocking antibody or an antagonist antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds such as CD20. Preferred blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen. Desirably the biological activity is reduced by 10 20 30 50 70 80 90 95 or even 100 .

An agonist antibody as used herein is an antibody which mimics at least one of the functional activities of a reference polypeptide of interest.

An anti idiotypic anti Id antibody is an antibody which recognizes unique determinants generally associated with the antigen binding site of an antibody. An Id antibody can be prepared by immunizing an animal of the same species and genetic type e.g. mouse strain as the source of the mAb with the mAb to which an anti Id is being prepared. The immunized animal will recognize and respond to the idiotypic determinants of the immunizing antibody by producing an antibody to these idiotypic determinants the anti Id antibody . See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 699 880 which is herein entirely incorporated by reference. The anti Id antibody may also be used as an immunogen to induce an immune response in yet another animal producing a so called anti anti Id antibody. The anti anti Id may be epitopically identical to the original mAb which induced the anti Id. Thus by using antibodies to the idiotypic determinants of a mAb it is possible to identify other clones expressing antibodies of identical specificity.

An isolated antibody is one separated and or recovered from its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred aspects the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by for example the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the CD20 antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

The term rituximab or RITUXAN refers to the commercially available chimeric anti CD20 antibody described as C2B8 in U.S. Pat. No. 5 736 137 Anderson et al. . The term 2F2 or ofatumumab refers to the fully human anti CD20 antibody as described in WO 2004 035607 Teeling et al. 2004 . The term GA101 or afutuzumab refers to the humanized and glyco engineered anti CD20 antibody consisting of the heavy chain B HH6 and light chain B KV1 as described in WO 2005 0448959 Umana U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 641 2005 . The term B1 refers to the murine anti CD20 antibody tositumomab which corresponds to the unlabeled antibody component of Bexxar .

As used herein the term Type III antibody includes an intact antibody or fragment thereof that binds to CD20 epitopes thereof and or isoforms thereof having the capability of substantially inducing apoptosis in the absence of cross linking agents similar to Type II antibodies and having the capability of causing redistribution of CD20 into a lipid raft and substantially inducing complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC similar to Type I antibodies.

As used herein the term engineered antibody or altered antibody includes an antibody with significant human frameworks and constant regions CL CH domains e.g. CH1 CH2 CH3 and hinge and CDRs derived from antigen binding antibodies such as anti CD20 antibodies or fragments thereof. Fully human frameworks comprise frameworks that correspond to human germline sequences as well as sequences with somatic mutations. CDRs may be derived from one or more CDRs that associate with or bind to antigen in or outside of the context of any antibody framework. For example the CDRs of the human engineered antibody of the present invention directed to CD20 may be derived from CDRs that bind antigen in the context of a mouse antibody framework and then are engineered to bind antigen in the context of a human framework. Often the human engineered antibody is substantially non immunogenic in humans.

Similarly antibodies designated primate monkey baboon chimpanzee etc. rodent mouse rat rabbit guinea pig hamster and the like and other mammals designate such species sub genus genus sub family and family specific antibodies. Further chimeric antibodies can include any combination of the above. Such changes or variations optionally and preferably retain or reduce the immunogenicity in humans or other species relative to non modified antibodies. A human engineered antibody is distinct from a chimeric or humanized antibody.

An engineered antibody can be produced by a non human animal or prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell that is capable of expressing functionally rearranged human or human engineered immunoglobulin e.g. heavy chain and or light chain genes. Further when a engineered antibody is a single chain antibody it can comprise a linker peptide that is not found in native human or non human antibodies. For example an Fv can comprise a linker peptide such as two to about eight glycine or other amino acid residues which connects the variable region of the heavy chain and the variable region of the light chain. Such linker peptides are considered to be of human origin.

Bispecific heterospecific heteroconjugate or similar antibodies can also be used that are monoclonal preferably human human engineered resurfaced or humanized antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens such as CD20 and a non CD20 antigen. In the present case one of the binding specificities is for at least one antigenic protein the other one is for another antigenic protein. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two heavy chains have different specificities Milstein and Cuello Nature 305 537 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of about 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually done by affinity chromatography steps or as otherwise described herein. Similar procedures are disclosed e.g. in WO 93 08829 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 210 668 6 193 967 6 132 992 6 106 833 6 060 285 6 037 453 6 010 902 5 989 530 5 959 084 5 959 083 5 932 448 5 833 985 5 821 333 5 807 706 5 643 759 5 601 819 5 582 996 5 496 549 4 676 980 WO 91 00360 WO 92 00373 EP 03089 Traunecker et al. EMBO J. 10 3655 1991 Suresh et al. Methods in Enzymology 121 210 1986 U.S. 20090258026 U.S. 20060140946 and U.S. 20070298040 each entirely incorporated herein by reference.

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor and B cell activation.

 Human effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. In certain aspects the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function s . Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source e.g. from blood.

 identity as known in the art is a measure of the relationship between two polynucleotides or two polypeptides as determined by comparing their sequences. Identity or similarity with respect to a sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical i.e. same residue or similar i.e. amino acid residue from the same group based on common side chain properties see below to anti CD20 antibody residues after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N terminal C terminal or internal extensions deletions or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity. In general the two sequences to be compared are aligned to give a maximum correlation between the sequences. The alignment of the two sequences is examined and the number of positions giving an exact amino acid or nucleotide correspondence between the two sequences determined divided by the total length of the alignment and multiplied by 100 to give a identity figure. This identity figure may be determined over the whole length of the sequences to be compared which is particularly suitable for sequences of the same or very similar length and which are highly homologous or over shorter defined lengths which is more suitable for sequences of unequal length or which have a lower level of homology.

For example sequences can be aligned with the software clustalW under Unix which generates a file with an .aln extension this file can then be imported into the Bioedit program Hall T. A. 1999 BioEdit a user friendly biological sequence alignment editor and analysis program for Windows 95 98 NT. Nucl. Acids. Symp. Ser. 41 95 98 which opens the .aln file. In the Bioedit window one can choose individual sequences two at a time and align them. This method allows for comparison of the entire sequence.

Methods for comparing the identity of two or more sequences are well known in the art. Thus for instance programs are available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package version 9.1 Devereux J. et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 12 387 395 1984 available from Genetics Computer Group Madison Wis. USA . The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example the programs BESTFIT and GAP may be used to determine the identity between two polynucleotides and the identity between two polypeptide sequences. BESTFIT uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman Advances in Applied Mathematics 2 482 489 1981 and finds the best single region of similarity between two sequences. BESTFIT is more suited to comparing two polynucleotide or two polypeptide sequences which are dissimilar in length the program assuming that the shorter sequence represents a portion of the longer. In comparison GAP aligns two sequences finding a maximum similarity according to the algorithm of Neddleman and Wunsch J. Mol. Biol. 48 443 354 1970 . GAP is more suited to comparing sequences which are approximately the same length and an alignment is expected over the entire length. Preferably the parameters Gap Weight and Length Weight used in each program are 50 and 3 for polynucleotides and 12 and 4 for polypeptides respectively. Preferably identities and similarities are determined when the two sequences being compared are optimally aligned.

Other programs for determining identity and or similarity between sequences are also known in the art for instance the BLAST family of programs Karlin Altschul 1990 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 2264 2268 modified as in Karlin Altschul 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 5873 5877 available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCB Bethesda Md. USA. These programs exemplify a preferred non limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al. 1990 J. Mol. Biol. 215 403 410. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program score 100 wordlength 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecule encoding all or a portion of any anti CD20 antibody of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program score 50 wordlength 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. 1997 Nucleic Acids Res. 25 3389 3402. Alternatively PSI Blast can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules Id. . When utilizing BLAST Gapped BLAST and PSI Blast programs the default parameters of the respective programs e.g. XBLAST and NBLAST can be used. Another preferred non limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller 1988 CABIOS 4 11 17. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program version 2.0 which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences a PAM120 weight residue table a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4 can be used.

Another non limiting example of a program for determining identity and or similarity between sequences known in the art is FASTA Pearson W. R. and Lipman D. J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 85 2444 2448 1988 available as part of the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package . Preferably the BLOSUM62 amino acid substitution matrix Henikoff S and Henikoff J. G. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 89 10915 10919 1992 is used in polypeptide sequence comparisons including where nucleotide sequences are first translated into amino acid sequences before comparison.

Yet another non limiting example of a program known in the art for determining identity and or similarity between amino acid sequences is SeqWeb Software a web based interface to the GCG Wisconsin Package Gap program which is utilized with the default algorithm and parameter settings of the program blosum62 gap weight 8 length weight 2.

The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described above with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity typically exact matches are counted.

The program BESTFIT can be used to determine the identity of a query polynucleotide or a polypeptide sequence with respect to a polynucleotide or a polypeptide sequence of the present invention the query and the reference sequence being optimally aligned and the parameters of the program set at the default value.

To generate an altered antibody one or more amino acid alterations e.g. substitutions are introduced in one or more of the hypervariable regions of an antibody. Alternatively or in addition one or more alterations e.g. substitutions of framework region residues may be introduced in an anti CD20 antibody where these result in an improvement in the binding affinity of the antibody mutant for the antigen. Examples of framework region residues to modify include those which non covalently bind antigen directly Amit et al. Science 233 747 753 1986 interact with effect the conformation of a CDR Chothia et al. J. Mol. Biol. 196 901 917 1987 and or participate in the VL VH interface. In certain aspects modification of one or more of such framework region residues results in an enhancement of the binding affinity of the antibody for the antigen. For example from about one to about five framework residues e.g. 1 2 3 4 or 5 may be altered in this aspect of the invention. Sometimes this may be sufficient to yield an antibody with an enhancement of the binding affinity even where none of the hypervariable region residues have been altered. Normally however an altered antibody will comprise additional hypervariable region alteration s .

The hypervariable region residues which are altered may be changed randomly especially where the starting binding affinity of an anti CD20 antibody for the antigen is such that such randomly produced altered antibody can be readily screened.

One useful procedure for generating such an altered antibody is called alanine scanning mutagenesis Cunningham and Wells Science 244 1081 1085 1989 . One or more of the hypervariable region residue s are replaced by alanine or polyalanine residue s to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the antigen. Those hypervariable region residue s demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing additional or other mutations at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. The Ala mutants produced this way are screened for their biological activity as described herein and or as known in the art.

Another procedure for generating such an altered antibody involves affinity maturation using phage display Hawkins et al. J. Mol. Biol. 254 889 896 1992 and Lowman et al. Biochemistry 30 45 10832 10837 1991 . Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibody mutants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed mutants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed and or as known in the art.

Mutations in antibody sequences may include substitutions deletions including internal deletions additions including additions yielding fusion proteins or conservative substitutions of amino acid residues within and or adjacent to the amino acid sequence but that result in a silent change in that the change produces a functionally equivalent anti CD20 antibody or fragment. Conservative amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity charge solubility hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. For example non polar hydrophobic amino acids include alanine leucine isoleucine valine proline phenylalanine tryptophan and methionine polar neutral amino acids include glycine serine threonine cysteine tyrosine asparagine and glutamine positively charged basic amino acids include arginine lysine and histidine and negatively charged acidic amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. In addition glycine and proline are residues can influence chain orientation. Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for a member of another class. Furthermore if desired non classical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the antibody sequence. Non classical amino acids include but are not limited to the D isomers of the common amino acids amino isobutyric acid 4 aminobutyric acid Abu 2 amino butyric acid Abu Ahx 6 amino hexanoic acid Aib 2 amino isobutyric acid 3 amino propionic acid ornithine norleucine norvaline hydroxyproline sarcosine citrulline cysteic acid t butylglycine t butylalanine phenylglycine cyclohexylalanine alanine fluoro amino acids designer amino acids such as methyl amino acids C methyl amino acids N methyl amino acids and amino acid analogs generally.

In another aspect the sites selected for modification are affinity matured using phage display see above .

Any technique for mutagenesis known in the art can be used to modify individual nucleotides in a DNA sequence for purposes of making amino acid substitution s in the antibody sequence or for creating deleting restriction sites to facilitate further manipulations. Such techniques include but are not limited to chemical mutagenesis in vitro site directed mutagenesis Kunkel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 488 1985 Hutchinson C. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 253 6551 1978 oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis Smith Ann. Rev. Genet. 19 423 463 1985 Hill et al. Methods Enzymol. 155 558 568 1987 PCR based overlap extension Ho et al. Gene 77 51 59 1989 PCR based megaprimer mutagenesis Sarkar et al. Biotechniques 8 404 407 1990 etc. Modifications can be confirmed by double stranded dideoxy DNA sequencing.

Significantly human engineered antibodies that are specific for human proteins or fragments thereof such as CD20 can be engineered for other immunogenic antigens or isoforms such as a CD20 protein and or a portion thereof including synthetic molecules such as synthetic peptides or any one of or combination of antigens such as CD56 human epidermal growth factor receptor HER1 IgE vascular endothelial growth factor HER dimerization inhibitors Bcl 2 family proteins MET IL 13 IFN alpha EGFL7 CD40 DR4 and DR5 PI3 kinase lymphotoxin alpha beta 7 integrin amyloid beta CRIg TNF complement C5 CBL CD147 IL 8 gp120 VLA 4 CD11a CD18 VEGF CD40L Id ICAM 1 CD2 EGFR TGF beta TNF alpha E selectin Fact VII TNF Her2 neu F gp CD11 18 CD14 ICAM 3 CD80 CD40L CD4 CD23 beta2 integrin alpha4beta7 CD52 HLA DR CD22 CD64 FcR TCR alpha beta CD2 CD3 Hep B CA 125 EpCAM gp120 CMV gpIIbIIIa IgE IL 5 IL 4 CD25 CD3 CD33 CD30 CD19 CD22 CD28 CD36 CD37 CD44 CD55 CD59 CD70 CD79 CD80 CD103 CD134 CD137 CD138 CD152 HLA VNRintegrin CD25 IL 23 and IL 12 for example.

See e.g. Ausubel supra and Colligan supra chapter 2 entirely incorporated herein by reference.

Antibody producing cells can also be obtained from the peripheral blood or preferably the spleen or lymph nodes of humans or other suitable animals that have been immunized with the antigen of interest. Any other suitable host cell can also be used for expressing heterologous or endogenous nucleic acid encoding an antibody specified fragment or variant thereof of the present invention. The fused cells hybridomas or recombinant cells can be isolated using selective culture conditions or other suitable known methods and cloned by limiting dilution or cell sorting or other known methods. Cells which produce antibodies with the desired specificity can be selected by a suitable assay e.g. ELISA and more specifically a CD20 ELISA .

A human antigen specific antibody can additionally be generated by immunization of a transgenic animal e.g. mouse rat hamster non human primate and the like capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies as described herein and or as known in the art. Cells that produce a antigen specific antibody can be isolated from such animals and immortalized using suitable methods such as the methods described herein.

The endogenous immunoglobulin loci in such mice can be disrupted or deleted to eliminate the capacity of the animal to produce antibodies encoded by endogenous genes.

Screening antibodies for specific binding to similar proteins or fragments can be conveniently achieved using peptide display libraries phage display and other known methods. Peptide display method involves the screening of large collections of peptides for individual members having the desired function or structure. Antibody screening of peptide display libraries is well known in the art. The displayed peptide sequences can be from 3 to 5000 or more amino acids in length frequently from 5 100 amino acids long and often from about 8 to 25 amino acids long. In addition to direct chemical synthetic methods for generating peptide libraries several recombinant DNA methods have been described. One type involves the display of a peptide sequence on the surface of a bacteriophage or cell. Each bacteriophage or cell contains the nucleotide sequence encoding the particular displayed peptide sequence. Such methods are described in PCT Patent Publication Nos. 91 17271 91 18980 91 19818 and 93 08278.

Other systems for generating libraries of peptides have aspects of both in vitro chemical synthesis and recombinant methods. Examples of these systems are described in for example PCT Patent Publication Nos. 92 05258 92 14843 and 96 19256. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 658 754 and 5 643 768. Peptide display libraries vector and screening kits are commercially available from such suppliers as Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. and Cambridge Antibody Technologies Cambridgeshire UK . Examples of these systems are described in for example U.S. Pat.

CD20 antibodies of the present invention can also be prepared using at least one antigen specific antibody encoding nucleic acid to provide transgenic animals or mammals such as goats cows horses sheep rabbits and the like that produce such antibodies in their milk. Such animals can be provided using known methods. Examples of these methods are described in for example but not limited to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 827 690 5 849 992 4 873 316 5 849 992 5 994 616 5 565 362 5 304 489 and the like. Each reference referred to herein is entirely incorporated by reference.

Anti CD20 antibodies of the present invention can additionally be prepared using at least one antigen specific antibody encoding nucleic acid to provide transgenic plants and cultured plant cells e.g. but not limited to tobacco and maize that produce such antibodies specified portions or variants in the plant parts or in cells cultured therefrom. As a non limiting example transgenic tobacco leaves expressing recombinant proteins are successfully used to provide large amounts of recombinant proteins e.g. using an inducible promoter. See e.g. Cramer et al. Curr. Top. Microbol. Immunol. 240 95 118 1999 and references cited therein. Also transgenic maize are used to express mammalian proteins at commercial production levels with biological activities equivalent to those produced in other recombinant systems or purified from natural sources. See e.g. Hood et al. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 464 127 147 1999 and references cited therein. Antibodies including antibody fragments such as single chain antibodies ScFvs are produced in large amounts from transgenic plant seeds including tobacco seeds and potato tubers. See e.g. Conrad et al. Plant Mol. Biol. 38 101 109 1998 and references cited therein. Thus CD20 antibodies of the present invention are produced using transgenic plants according to known methods. See also e.g. Fischer et al. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 30 99 108 October 1999 Ma et al. Trends Biotechnol. 13 522 7 1995 Ma et al. Plant Physiol. 109 341 6 1995 Whitelam et al. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 22 940 944 1994 and references cited therein.

Methods for engineering humanizing or resurfacing non human or human antibodies can also be used and are well known in the art. A humanized resurfaced or similarly engineered antibody may have one or more amino acid residues from a source that is non human e.g. but not limited to mouse rat rabbit non human primate or other mammal. These non human amino acid residues are replaced by residues that are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable constant or other domain of a known human sequence.

Known human Ig sequences are disclosed e.g. in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest U.S. Dept. Health 1983 each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

Such imported sequences can be used to reduce immunogenicity or reduce enhance or modify binding affinity on rate off rate avidity specificity half life or any other suitable characteristic as known in the art. In general the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing CD20 binding. Accordingly part or all of the non human or human CDR sequences are maintained while the non human sequences of the variable and constant regions may be replaced with human or other amino acids.

Antibodies can also optionally be humanized resurfaced engineered or human antibodies engineered with retention of high affinity for the antigen CD20 and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal humanized or human or engineered anti CD20 antibodies and resurfaced antibodies can be optionally prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized and engineered products using three dimensional models of the parental engineered and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen such as CD20. In this way framework FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved.

Humanization resurfacing or engineering of antibodies of the present invention can be performed using any known method such as but not limited to those described in Winter Jones et al. Nature 321 522 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 1988 Verhoeyen et al. Science 239 1534 1988 Sims et al. J. Immunol. 151 2296 1993 Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196 901 1987 Carter et al. Proc.

In certain aspects the antibody comprises an altered e.g. mutated Fc region. For example in some aspects the Fc region has been altered to reduce or enhance the effector functions of the antibody. In some aspects the Fc region is an isotype selected from IgM IgA IgG IgE or other isotype.

Alternatively or additionally it may be useful to combine amino acid modifications with one or more further amino acid modifications that alter C1q binding and or the complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC function of the Fc region of an antigen binding molecule. The starting polypeptide of particular interest may be one that binds to C1q and displays complement dependent cytotoxicity. Polypeptides with pre existing C1q binding activity optionally further having the ability to mediate CDC may be modified such that one or both of these activities are enhanced. Amino acid modifications that alter C1q and or modify its complement dependent cytotoxicity function are described for example in WO0042072 which is hereby entirely incorporated by reference.

One can design an Fc region of an antibody of the present invention with altered effector function e.g. by modifying C1q binding and or Fc R binding and thereby changing CDC activity and or ADCC activity. Effector functions are responsible for activating or diminishing a biological activity e.g. in a subject . Examples of effector functions include but are not limited to C1q binding complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor BCR etc. Such effector functions may require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain e.g. an antibody variable domain and can be assessed using various assays e.g. Fc binding assays ADCC assays CDC assays etc. .

For example one can generate a variant Fc region of the engineered anti CD20 antibody with improved C1q binding and improved Fc RIII binding e.g. having both improved ADCC activity and improved CDC activity . Alternatively if it is desired that effector function be reduced or ablated a variant Fc region can be engineered with reduced CDC activity and or reduced ADCC activity. In other aspects only one of these activities may be increased and optionally also the other activity reduced e.g. to generate an Fc region variant with improved ADCC activity but reduced CDC activity and vice versa . An exemplary Fc mutant is the triple residue change S239D A330L and 1332D EU numbering system in which ADCC is enhanced and CDC activity is diminished. Non limiting methods for designing such mutants can be found for example in Lazar et al. 2006 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103 11 4005 4010 and Okazaki et al. 2004 J. Mol. Biol. 336 5 1239 49 .

Fc mutations can also be introduced in engineered antibodies to alter their interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn and improve their pharmacokinetic properties. A collection of human Fc variants with improved binding to the FcRn have been described and include for example Shields et al. 2001.

Another type of amino acid substitution serves to alter the glycosylation pattern of the Fc region of an antibody. Glycosylation of an Fc region is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked generally refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain peptide sequences are asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline. Thus the presence of either of these peptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation generally refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

The glycosylation pattern of an antibody or fragment thereof may be altered for example by deleting one or more glycosylation site s found in the polypeptide and or adding one or more glycosylation site s that are not present in the polypeptide. Removal of glycosylation sites in the Fc region of a antibody or antibody fragment is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it eliminates one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites . An exemplary glycosylation variant has an amino acid substitution of residue N297 to A297 EU numbering system of the heavy chain. The removal of an O linked glycosylation site may also be achieved by the substitution of one or more glycosylated serine or threonine residues with any amino acid besides serine or threonine.

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in for example US Pat. Appl. No. US 2003 0157108 Presta L. and US 2004 0093621 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Antibodies with a bisecting N acetylglucosamine GlcNAc in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in for example WO 2003 011878 Jean Mairet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in for example WO 1997 30087 Patel et al. See also WO 1998 58964 and WO 1999 22764 Raju S. concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof. See also for example US 2005 0123546 Umana et al. regarding antigen binding molecules with modified glycosylation.

In certain aspects a glycosylation variant comprises an Fc region wherein a carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc region lacks fucose. Such variants have improved ADCC function. Examples of publications related to defucosylated or fucose deficient antibodies include US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 Okazaki et al. J. Mol. Biol. 336 1239 1249 2004 Yamane Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87 614 2004 . Non limiting examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation Ripka et al. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 249 533 545 1986 US Pat. Appl.

In certain aspects the antibody of the present invention is expressed in cells that express beta 1 4 N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III GnT III such that GnT III adds GlcNAc to the human engineered antigen specific antibody. Methods for producing antibodies in such a fashion are provided in WO 9954342 WO 03011878 patent publication 20030003097A1 and Umana et al. Nature Biotechnology 17 176 180 February 1999.

The antibodies of the invention bind human CD20 with a wide range of affinities K . In a preferred aspect at least one mAb of the present invention can optionally bind human antigen with high affinity. For example a human or human engineered or humanized or resurfaced mAb can bind human antigen with a Kequal to or less than about 10M such as but not limited to 0.1 9.9 or any range or value therein 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10or any range or value therein as determined by enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA surface plasmon resonance SPR or the KinExA method as practiced by those of skill in the art. The anti CD20 antibodies bind with a Kd of about 10M or less more specifically about 10to 10M.

The affinity or avidity of an antibody for an antigen is determined experimentally using any suitable method well known in the art e.g. enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA or radioimmunoassay RIA or kinetics e.g. BIACORE analysis . Direct binding assays as well as competitive binding assay formats can be readily employed. See for example Berzofsky et al. Antibody Antigen Interactions In Fundamental Immunology Paul W. E. Ed. Raven Press New York N.Y. 1984 Kuby Janis Immunology W. H. Freeman and Company New York N.Y. 1992 and methods described herein. The measured affinity of a particular antibody antigen interaction can vary if measured under different conditions e.g. salt concentration pH temperature . Thus measurements of affinity and other antigen binding parameters e.g. KD or K K K are preferably made with standardized solutions of antibody and antigen and a standardized buffer as known in the art and such as the buffer described herein.

In one aspect binding assays can be performed using enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay e.g. ELISA with CD20 antigen. For example crude cell lysates prepared from CD20 expressing B cell lines or recombinant protein can be used as a source of CD20 antigen as described herein. Such CD20 antigen preparations are coated onto Immulon 2HB plates in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 at 100 L well for approximately 18 to 24 hrs at 4 C. Plates are washed with wash buffer 0.1 Tween 20 in TBS pH 7.4 . Subsequently plates are blocked with 1 casein in TBS pH 7.4 for 1 hour at room temperature. Serial dilutions of antibodies are added to the plates and incubated for approximately 3 hours at room temperature and then washed as before. For detection an HRP conjugated goat anti human or goat anti murine antibody is added as a secondary antibody and allowed to incubate for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates are washed as before and 100 L well of TMB1 substrate BioFX is added to develop. The reaction is quenched with 100 L well of 450 nm stop reagent BioFX after approximately 20 min. The absorbance at 450 nm is read and plotted against the antibody concentration for each antibody. A sigmoidal dose response curve is fitted for binding curves and EC50 values are calculated using programs such as GraphPad Prism v4 with default parameters GraphPad software San Diego Calif. . EC50 values can be used as a measure for the apparent dissociation constant K or KD for each antibody.

Percent amino acid sequence identity with respect to a peptide or polypeptide sequence is also defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance those discussed herein such as by using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or Megalign DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. In situations where ALIGN 2 is available and can be employed for amino acid sequence comparisons the amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to with or against a given amino acid sequence B which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain amino acid sequence identity to with or against a given amino acid sequence B is calculated as follows 100 times the fraction X Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN 2 in that program s alignment of A and B and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B the amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the amino acid sequence identity of B to A.

Desirably two or more amino acid sequences are at least 50 60 70 80 or 90 identical. More desirably two or more amino acid sequences are at least 95 96 97 98 99 or even 100 identical. Unless specifically stated otherwise all amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using for example the ALIGN 2 or BLAST computer programs.

Generally some forms of the antigen specific antibodies useful in the methods and compositions of the present invention can optionally be characterized by high affinity binding to antigen and optionally and preferably as having low toxicity and adverse consequences on the recipient. In particular an antibody specified fragment or variant of the invention where the individual components such as the variable region constant region and framework individually and or collectively optionally and preferably possess low immunogenicity is useful in the present invention. The antibodies that can be used in the invention are optionally characterized by their ability to treat patients for extended periods with measurable alleviation of symptoms and low and or acceptable toxicity. Low or acceptable immunogenicity and or high affinity as well as other suitable properties can contribute to the therapeutic results achieved. Low immunogenicity is defined herein as at least the incidence of titrable levels of antibodies to an antigen in patients treated with an antibody as occurring in less than 25 of patients treated preferably in less than 10 of patients treated with the recommended dose for the recommended course of therapy during the treatment period.

Preferred antigen specific CD20 antibodies of the invention have the sequences shown. For example an antigen specific antibody of the invention includes one of the light chain CDR sequences shown in Table 1 i.e. CDRL1 CDRL2 and CDRL3 and or one of the heavy chain CDR sequences shown in Table 1 i.e. CDRH1 CDRH2 and CDRH3 . More specifically an anti CD20 6 antibody has the CDRL1 of SEQ ID NO 25 CDRL2 of SEQ ID NO 26 CDRL3 of SEQ ID NO 27 CDRH1 of SEQ ID NO 28 CDRH2 of SEQ ID NO 29 CDRH3 of SEQ ID NO 30. And an anti CD20 7 antibody has the CDRL1 of SEQ ID NO 17 CDRL2 of SEQ ID NO 18 CDRL3 of SEQ ID NO 19 CDRH1 of SEQ ID NO 20 CDRH2 of SEQ ID NO 21 CDRH3 of SEQ ID NO 22.

Functional equivalents further include fragments of antibodies that have the same or comparable binding characteristics to those of the whole or intact antibody. Such fragments may contain one or both Fab fragments or the F ab fragment. Preferably the antibody fragments contain all six complementarity determining regions of the whole antibody although fragments containing fewer than all of such regions such as one two three four or five CDRs are also functional. Further the functional equivalents may be or may combine members of any one of the following immunoglobulin classes IgG IgM IgA IgD or IgE and the subclasses thereof.

In certain aspects of the invention the anti CD20 antibodies can be modified to produce fusion proteins i.e. the antibody or a fragment fused to a heterologous protein polypeptide or peptide. In certain aspects the protein fused to the portion of an anti CD20 antibody is an enzyme component of ADEPT. Examples of other proteins or polypeptides that can be engineered as a fusion protein with an anti CD20 antibody include but are not limited to toxins such as ricin abrin ribonuclease DNase I Staphylococcal enterotoxin A pokeweed anti viral protein gelonin diphtherin toxin exotoxin and endotoxin. See for example Pastan et al. Cell 47 641 1986 and Goldenberg et al. Cancer Journal for Clinicians 44 43 1994 . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain non binding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. Non limiting examples are included in for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993 incorporated entirely herein by reference.

Additional fusion proteins may be generated through the techniques of gene shuffling motif shuffling exon shuffling and or codon shuffling collectively referred to as DNA shuffling . DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the activities of the antibodies or fragments thereof e.g. an antibody or a fragment thereof with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates . See generally U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 605 793 5 811 238 5 830 721 5 834 252 and 5 837 458 and Patten et al. 1997 Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8 724 33 Harayama 1998 Trends Biotechnol. 16 2 76 82 Hansson et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 287 265 76 and Lorenzo and Blasco 1998 Biotechniques 24 2 308 313 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The antibody can further be a binding domain immunoglobulin fusion protein as described in U.S. Publication 20030118592 U.S. Publication 200330133939 and PCT Publication WO 02 056910 all to Ledbetter et al. which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

Domain Antibodies. The anti CD20 antibodies of the compositions and methods of the invention can be domain antibodies e.g. antibodies containing the small functional binding units of antibodies corresponding to the variable regions of the heavy VH or light VL chains of human antibodies. Examples of domain antibodies include but are not limited to those available from Domantis Limited Cambridge UK and Domantis Inc. Cambridge Mass. USA that are specific to therapeutic targets see for example WO04 058821 WO04 003019 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 291 158 6 582 915 6 696 245 and 6 593 081 . Commercially available libraries of domain antibodies can be used to identify anti CD20 domain antibodies. In certain aspects the anti CD20 antibodies of the invention comprise a CD20 functional binding unit and a Fc gamma receptor functional binding unit.

Diabodies. The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 and Hollinger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 6444 6448 1993 .

Vaccibodies. In certain aspects of the invention the anti CD20 antibodies are vaccibodies. Vaccibodies are dimeric polypeptides. Each monomer of a vaccibody consists of a scFv with specificity for a surface molecule on an APC connected through a hinge region and a Cg3 domain to a second scFv. In other aspects of the invention vaccibodies containing as one of the scFv s an anti CD20 antibody fragment may be used to juxtapose B cells to be destroyed and an effector cell that mediates ADCC. For example see Bogen et al. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040253238.

Linear Antibodies. In certain aspects of the invention the anti CD20 antibodies are linear antibodies. Linear antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments VH CH1 VH CH1 which form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific. Non limiting examples of linear antibodies are disclosed in for example Zapata et al. Protein Eng. 8 10 1057 1062 1995 .

Parent Antibody. In certain aspects of the invention the anti CD20 antibody is a parent antibody. A parent antibody is an antibody comprising an amino acid sequence which lacks or is deficient in one or more amino acid residues in or adjacent to one or more hypervariable regions thereof compared to an altered mutant antibody as herein disclosed. Thus the parent antibody has a shorter hypervariable region than the corresponding hypervariable region of an antibody mutant as herein disclosed. The parent polypeptide may comprise a native sequence i.e. a naturally occurring antibody including a naturally occurring allelic variant or an antibody with pre existing amino acid sequence modifications such as other insertions deletions and or substitutions of a naturally occurring sequence. Preferably the parent antibody is a humanized antibody or a human antibody.

Antibody Fragments. Antibody fragments comprise a portion of a full length antibody generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab 2 and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments among others.

Traditionally fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. Science 229 81 1985 . However fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries as discussed herein. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab 2 fragments Carter et al. Bio Technology 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab 2 fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments are apparent to the skilled practitioner given the detailed teachings in the present specification. In other aspects the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See for example WO 93 16185. In certain aspects the antibody is not a Fab fragment.

Bispecific Antibodies. Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of CD20. Other such antibodies may bind CD20 and further bind a second antigen. Alternatively a CD20 binding arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule e.g. CD2 or CD3 or Fc receptors for IgG Fc R so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the target. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to the target. These antibodies possess a cell marker binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methola exate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. See for example Millstein et al. Nature 305 537 539 1983 Traunecker et al. EMBO J. 10 3655 3659 1991 Suresh et al. Methods in Enzymology 121 210 1986 Kostelny et al. J. Immunol. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 Hollinger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 6444 6448 1993 Gruber et al. J. Immunol. 152 5368 1994 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 474 893 4 714 681 4 925 648 5 573 920 5 601 81 95 731 168 4 676 980 and 4 676 980 WO 94 04690 WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 WO 93 17715 WO 92 08802 EP 03089 and US 2009 0048122.

In certain aspects of the invention the compositions and methods comprise a bispecific murine antibody or fragment thereof and or conjugates thereof with specificity for human CD20 and the CD3 epsilon chain of the T cell receptor such as the bispecific antibody described by Daniel et al. Blood 92 4750 4757 1998 . In preferred aspects where the anti CD20 antibody or fragments thereof and or conjugates thereof of the compositions and methods of the invention is bispecific the anti CD20 antibody is human or humanized and has specificity for human CD20 and an epitope on a T cell or is capable of binding to a human effector cell such as for example a monocyte macrophage and or a natural killer cell to effect cell death.

In certain aspects of the invention the anti CD20 antibodies can be modified to alter their binding affinity for the CD20 and antigenic fragments thereof. Binding properties may be determined by a variety of in vitro assay methods known in the art e.g. enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA or radioimmunoassay RIA or kinetics e.g. BIACORE analysis It is generally understood that a binding molecule having a low KD is preferred.

In one aspect of the present invention antibodies or antibody fragments specifically bind CD20 and antigenic fragments thereof with a dissociation constant or KD or Kd k k of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M.

In another aspect the antibody or fragment of the invention binds to CD20 and or antigenic fragments thereof with a Kof less than 1 10s or less than 3 10s. In other aspects the antibody binds to CD20 and antigenic fragments thereof with a Kless than 10sless than 5 10s less than 10s less than 5 10s less than 10s less than 5 10less than 10s less than 5 10s less than 10s less than 5 10s less than 10s less than 5 10s less than 10s less than 5 10s or less than 10 s.

In another aspect the antibody or fragment of the invention binds to CD20 and or antigenic fragments thereof with an association rate constant or krate of at least 10Ms at least 5 10Ms at least 10Ms at least 5 10Ms at least 10Ms at least 5 10M or at least 10Ms or at least 10Ms.

One of skill understands that the conjugates of the invention have the same properties as those described herein.

In certain aspects of the invention the anti CD20 antibodies can be modified to alter their isoelectric point pI . Antibodies like all polypeptides have a pI which is generally defined as the pH at which a polypeptide carries no net charge. It is known in the art that protein solubility is typically lowest when the pH of the solution is equal to the isoelectric point pI of the protein. As used herein the pI value is defined as the pI of the predominant charge form. The pI of a protein may be determined by a variety of methods including but not limited to isoelectric focusing and various computer algorithms see e.g. Bjellqvist et al. 1993 Electrophoresis 14 1023 . In addition the thermal melting temperatures Tm of the Fab domain of an antibody can be a good indicator of the thermal stability of an antibody and may further provide an indication of the shelf life. A lower Tm indicates more aggregation less stability whereas a higher Tm indicates less aggregation more stability. Thus in certain aspects antibodies having higher Tm are preferable. Tm of a protein domain e.g. a Fab domain can be measured using any standard method known in the art for example by differential scanning calorimetry see e.g. Vermeer et al. 2000 Biophys. J. 78 394 404 Vermeer et al. 2000 Biophys. J. 79 2150 2154 .

Accordingly an additional nonexclusive aspect of the present invention includes modified antibodies that have certain preferred biochemical characteristics such as a particular isoelectric point pI or melting temperature Tm .

More specifically in one aspect the modified antibodies of the present invention have a pI ranging from 5.5 to 9.5. In still another specific aspect the modified antibodies of the present invention have a pI that ranges from about 5.5 to about 6.0 or about 6.0 to about 6.5 or about 6.5 to about 7.0 or about 7.0 to about 7.5 or about 7.5 to about 8.0 or about 8.0 to about 8.5 or about 8.5 to about 9.0 or about 9.0 to about 9.5. In other specific aspects the modified antibodies of the present invention have a pI that ranges from 5.5 6.0 or 6.0 to 6.5 or 6.5 to 7.0 or 7.0 7.5 or 7.5 8.0 or 8.0 8.5 or 8.5 9.0 or 9.0 9.5. Even more specifically the modified antibodies of the present invention have a pI of at least 5.5 or at least 6.0 or at least 6.3 or at least 6.5 or at least 6.7 or at least 6.9 or at least 7.1 or at least 7.3 or at least 7.5 or at least 7.7 or at least 7.9 or at least 8.1 or at least 8.3 or at least 8.5 or at least 8.7 or at least 8.9 or at least 9.1 or at least 9.3 or at least 9.5. In other specific aspects the modified antibodies of the present invention have a pI of at least about 5.5 or at least about 6.0 or at least about 6.3 or at least about 6.5 or at least about 6.7 or at least about 6.9 or at least about 7.1 or at least about 7.3 or at least about 7.5 or at least about 7.7 or at least about 7.9 or at least about 8.1 or at least about 8.3 or at least about 8.5 or at least about 8.7 or at least about 8.9 or at least about 9.1 or at least about 9.3 or at least about 9.5.

It is possible to optimize solubility by altering the number and location of ionizable residues in the antibody to adjust the pI. For example the pI of a polypeptide can be manipulated by making the appropriate amino acid substitutions e.g. by substituting a charged amino acid such as a lysine for an uncharged residue such as alanine . Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory amino acid substitutions of an antibody that result in changes of the pI of said antibody may improve solubility and or the stability of the antibody. One skilled in the art would understand which amino acid substitutions would be most appropriate for a particular antibody to achieve a desired pI. In one aspect a substitution is generated in an antibody of the invention to alter the pI. It is specifically contemplated that the substitution s of the Fc region that result in altered binding to Fc R described supra may also result in a change in the pI. In another aspect substitution s of the Fc region are specifically chosen to effect both the desired alteration in Fc R binding and any desired change in pI.

In one aspect the modified antibodies of the present invention have a Tm ranging from 65 C. to 120 C.

It may be desirable to modify the anti CD20 antibody of the invention with respect to effector function so as to enhance the effectiveness of the antibody in treating an B cell associated disease a cancer a GVHD or rejection for example. For example cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . See Caron et al. J. Exp Med. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes B. J. Immunol. 148 2918 2922 1992 . Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross linkers as described in Wolff et al. Cancer Research 53 2560 2565 1993 . Alternatively an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. Anti Cancer Drug Design 3 219 230 1989 .

Other methods of engineering Fc regions of antibodies so as to alter effector functions are known in the art e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040185045 and PCT Publication No. WO 2004 016750 both to Koenig et al. which describe altering the Fc region to enhance the binding affinity for Fc RIIB as compared with the binding affinity for FC RIIA see also PCT Publication Nos.

Variant Fc Regions. The present invention provides formulation of proteins comprising a variant Fc region. That is a non naturally occurring Fc region for example an Fc region comprising one or more non naturally occurring amino acid residues. Also encompassed by the variant Fc regions of the present invention are Fc regions which comprise amino acid deletions additions and or modifications.

It will be understood that Fc region as used herein includes the polypeptides comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA IgD and IgG and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM and the flexible hinge N terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains C 2 and C 3 C 2 and C 3 and the hinge between C 1 C 1 and C 2 C 2 . Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl terminus wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat et al. 1991 NIH Publication 91 3242 National Technical Information Service Springfield Va. . The EU index as set forth in Kabat refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody as described in Kabat et al. supra. Fc may refer to this region in isolation or this region in the context of an antibody antibody fragment or Fc fusion protein. An Fc variant protein may be an antibody Fc fusion or any protein or protein domain that comprises an Fc region. Particularly preferred are proteins comprising variant Fc regions which are non naturally occurring variants of an Fc. Polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions including but not limited to Kabat 270 272 312 315 356 and 358 and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the prior art may exist and would be known to one of skill in the art based on the present teachings.

The present invention encompasses Fc variant proteins which have altered binding properties for an Fc ligand e.g. an Fc receptor C1q relative to a comparable molecule e.g. a protein having the same amino acid sequence except having a wild type Fc region . Examples of binding properties include but are not limited to binding specificity equilibrium dissociation constant K dissociation and association rates Kand K binding affinity and or avidity. It is generally understood that a binding molecule e.g. a Fc variant protein such as an antibody with a low KD is preferable to a binding molecule with a high KD. However in some instances the value of the Kor Kmay be more relevant than the value of the KD. One skilled in the art can determine which kinetic parameter is most important for a given antibody application.

The affinities and binding properties of an Fc domain for its ligand may be determined by a variety of in vitro assay methods biochemical or immunological based assays known in the art for determining Fc Fc R interactions i.e. specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc R including but not limited to equilibrium methods e.g. enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA or radioimmunoassay RIA or kinetics e.g. BIACORE analysis and other methods such as indirect binding assays competitive inhibition assays fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET gel electrophoresis and chromatography e.g. gel filtration . These and other methods may utilize a label on one or more of the components being examined and or employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic fluorescent luminescent or isotopic labels. A detailed description of binding affinities and kinetics can be found in for example Paul W. E. ed. Fundamental Immunology 4th Ed. Lippincott Raven Philadelphia 1999 .

For example a modification that enhances Fc binding to one or more positive regulators e.g. Fc RIIIA while leaving unchanged or even reducing Fc binding to the negative regulator Fc RIIB would be more preferable for enhancing ADCC activity. Alternatively a modification that reduced binding to one or more positive regulator and or enhanced binding to Fc RIIB would be preferable for reducing ADCC activity. Accordingly the ratio of binding affinities e.g. equilibrium dissociation constants KD can indicate if the ADCC activity of an Fc variant is enhanced or decreased. For example a decrease in the ratio of Fc RIIIA Fc RIIB equilibrium dissociation constants KD will correlate with improved ADCC activity while an increase in the ratio will correlate with a decrease in ADCC activity. Additionally modifications that enhanced binding to C1q would be preferable for enhancing CDC activity while modification that reduced binding to C1q would be preferable for reducing or eliminating CDC activity.

In one aspect the Fc variants of the invention bind Fc RIIIA with increased affinity relative to a comparable molecule. In another aspect the Fc variants of the invention bind Fc RIIIA with increased affinity and bind Fc RIIB with a binding affinity that is unchanged relative to a comparable molecule. In still another aspect the Fc variants of the invention bind Fc RIIIA with increased affinity and bind Fc RIIB with a decreased affinity relative to a comparable molecule. In yet another aspect the Fc variants of the invention have a ratio of Fc RIIIA Fc RIIB equilibrium dissociation constants KD that is decreased relative to a comparable molecule.

In one aspect the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to one or more Fc ligand relative to a comparable molecule. In another aspect the Fc variant protein has an affinity for an Fc ligand that is at least 2 fold or at least 3 fold or at least 5 fold or at least 7 fold or a least 10 fold or at least 20 fold or at least 30 fold or at least 40 fold or at least 50 fold or at least 60 fold or at least 70 fold or at least 80 fold or at least 90 fold or at least 100 fold or at least 200 fold greater than that of a comparable molecule. In a specific aspect the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to an Fc receptor. In another specific aspect the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor Fc RIIIA. In still another specific aspect the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor FcRn. In yet another specific aspect the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to C1q relative to a comparable molecule.

In another aspect an Fc variant of the invention has an equilibrium dissociation constant KD that is decreased between about 2 fold and about 10 fold or between about 5 fold and about 50 fold or between about 25 fold and about 250 fold or between about 100 fold and about 500 fold or between about 250 fold and about 1000 fold relative to a comparable molecule. In another aspect an Fc variant of the invention has an equilibrium dissociation constant KD that is decreased between 2 fold and 10 fold or between 5 fold and 50 fold or between 25 fold and 250 fold or between 100 fold and 500 fold or between 250 fold and 1000 fold relative to a comparable molecule. In a specific aspect the Fc variants have an equilibrium dissociation constants KD for Fc RIIIA that is reduced by at least 2 fold or at least 3 fold or at least 5 fold or at least 7 fold or a least 10 fold or at least 20 fold or at least 30 fold or at least 40 fold or at least 50 fold or at least 60 fold or at least 70 fold or at least 80 fold or at least 90 fold or at least 100 fold or at least 200 fold or at least 400 fold or at least 600 fold relative to a comparable molecule.

The serum half life of proteins comprising Fc regions may be increased by increasing the binding affinity of the Fc region for FcRn. In one aspect the Fc variant protein has enhanced serum half life relative to comparable molecule.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enables these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. High affinityh IgG antibodies for example directed to the surface of target cells arm the cytotoxic cells and afford such killing. Lysis of the target cell is extracellular requires direct cell to cell contact and does not involve complement. It is contemplated that in addition to antibodies other proteins comprising Fc regions specifically Fc fusion proteins having the capacity to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell will be able to effect cell mediated cytotoxicity. For simplicity the cell mediated cytotoxicity resulting from the activity of an Fc fusion protein is also referred to herein as ADCC activity.

The ability of any particular Fc variant protein to mediate lysis of the target cell by ADCC can be assayed. To assess ADCC activity an Fc variant protein of interest is added to target cells in combination with immune effector cells which may be activated by the antigen antibody complexes resulting in cytolysis of the target cell. Cytolysis is generally detected by the release of label e.g. radioactive substrates fluorescent dyes or natural intracellular proteins from the lysed cells. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Specific examples of in vitro ADCC assays are described in Wisecarver et al. 1985 79 277 282 Bruggemann et al. 1987 J Exp Med 166 1351 1361 Wilkinson et al. 2001 J Immunol Methods 258 183 191 and Patel et al. 1995 Immunol Methods 184 29 38. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the Fc variant protein of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 1998 PNAS USA 95 652 656.

In one aspect an Fc variant protein has enhanced ADCC activity relative to a comparable molecule. In a specific aspect an Fc variant protein has ADCC activity that is at least 2 fold or at least 3 fold or at least 5 fold or at least 10 fold or at least 50 fold or at least 100 fold greater than that of a comparable molecule. In another specific aspect an Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor Fc RIIIA and has enhanced ADCC activity relative to a comparable molecule. In other aspects the Fc variant protein has both enhanced ADCC activity and enhanced serum half life relative to a comparable molecule.

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity and CDC refer to the lysing of a target cell in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to a molecule an antibody for example complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 1996 J. Immunol. Methods 202 163 may be performed. In one aspect an Fc variant protein has enhanced CDC activity relative to a comparable molecule. In a specific aspect an Fc variant protein has CDC activity that is at least 2 fold or at least 3 fold or at least 5 fold or at least 10 fold or at least 50 fold or at least 100 fold greater than that of a comparable molecule. In other aspects the Fc variant protein has both enhanced CDC activity and enhanced serum half life relative to a comparable molecule.

Also encompassed by the present invention are Fc regions which comprise deletions additions and or modifications. Still other modifications substitutions additions deletions of the Fe domain will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art.

Methods for generating non naturally occurring Fc regions are known in the art. For example amino acid substitutions and or deletions can be generated by mutagenesis methods including but not limited to site directed mutagenesis e.g. Kunkel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 488 492 1985 PCR mutagenesis e.g. Higuchi in PCR Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications Academic Press San Diego pp. 177 183 1990 and cassette mutagenesis e.g. Wells et al. Gene 34 315 323 1985 . Preferably site directed mutagenesis is performed by the overlap extension PCR method e.g. Higuchi in PCR Technology Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification Stockton Press New York pp. 61 70 1989 . Alternatively the technique of overlap extension PCR e.g. Higuchi supra. can be used to introduce any desired mutation s into a target sequence the starting DNA . For example the first round of PCR in the overlap extension method involves amplifying the target sequence with an outside primer primer 1 and an internal mutagenesis primer primer 3 and separately with a second outside primer primer 4 and an internal primer primer 2 yielding two PCR segments segments A and B . The internal mutagenesis primer primer 3 is designed to contain mismatches to the target sequence specifying the desired mutation s . In the second round of PCR the products of the first round of PCR segments A and B are amplified by PCR using the two outside primers primers 1 and 4 . The resulting full length PCR segment segment C is digested with restriction enzymes and the resulting restriction fragment is cloned into an appropriate vector. As the first step of mutagenesis the starting DNA e.g. encoding an Fc fusion protein an antibody or simply an Fc region is operably cloned into a mutagenesis vector. The primers are designed to reflect the desired amino acid substitution. Other exemplary methods useful for the generation of variant Fc regions are known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat.

In some aspects an Fc variant protein comprises one or more engineered glycoforms i.e. a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to the molecule comprising an Fc region. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes including but not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by methods disclosed herein and any method known to one skilled in the art for example by using engineered or variant expression strains by using growth conditions or media affecting glycosylation by co expression with one or more enzymes for example DI N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III GnTI11 by expressing a molecule comprising an Fc region in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms or by modifying carbohydrate s after the molecule comprising Fc region has been expressed. Methods for generating engineered glycoforms are known in the art and include but are not limited to those described in Umana et al. 1999 Nat.

The present invention further provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention or epitope binding fragments thereof.

The present invention also encompasses polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide that can bind CD20 and that hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to polynucleotides that encode an antibody of the present invention wherein said stringent hybridization conditions include pre hybridization for 2 hours at 60 C. in 6 SSC 0.5 SDS 5 Denhardt s solution and 100 g ml heat denatured salmon sperm DNA hybridization for 18 hours at 60 C. washing twice in 4 SSC 0.5 SDS 0.1 sodium pyrophosphate for 30 min at 60 C. and twice in 2 SSC 0.1 SDS for 30 min at 60 C.

The polynucleotides may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined methods known in the art. For example if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. 199417 242 which briefly involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligation of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.

Methods for the construction of recombinant vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals are well known in the art. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention thus provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the present invention or a heavy or light chain thereof or a heavy or light chain variable domain or an epitope binding fragment of any of these operably linked to a promoter.

The recombinant vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention or an epitope binding fragment thereof operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred aspects vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co expressed in the host cell for expression of an entire immunoglobulin molecule.

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells which may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. and transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences yeast e.g. and transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing antibody coding sequences plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing antibody coding sequences or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 3T3 cells harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter .

Preferably bacterial cells such as and more preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies for example as disclosed in Foecking et al. 1986 Gene 45 101 Cockett et al. 1990 Bio Technology 8 2 .

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoters enhancers transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.

Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been recombinantly expressed it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In this regard U.S. Pat. No. 7 538 195 has been referred to in the present disclosure the teachings of which are hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.

In another aspect diverse antibodies and antibody fragments as well as antibody mimics may be readily produced by mutation deletion and or insertion within the variable and constant region sequences that flank a particular set of CDRs. Thus for example different classes of Ab are possible for a given set of CDRs by substitution of different heavy chains whereby for example IgG1 4 IgM IgA1 2 IgD IgE antibody types and isotypes may be produced. Similarly artificial antibodies within the scope of the invention may be produced by embedding a given set of CDRs within an entirely synthetic framework. The term variable is used herein to describe certain portions of the variable domains that differ in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its antigen. However the variability is not usually evenly distributed through the variable domains of the antibodies. It is typically concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions CDRs or hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework FR . The variable domains of heavy and light chains each comprise four framework regions largely adopting a beta sheet configuration connected by three CDRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the beta sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see for example E. A. Kabat et al. fifth edition 1991 NIH . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

Humanized antibodies or antibodies adapted for non rejection by other mammals may be produced using several technologies such as resurfacing and CDR grafting. In the resurfacing technology molecular modeling statistical analysis and mutagenesis are combined to adjust the non CDR surfaces of variable regions to resemble the surfaces of known antibodies of the target host. Strategies and methods for the resurfacing of antibodies and other methods for reducing immunogenicity of antibodies within a different host are disclosed in for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 641 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference. In the CDR grafting technology the murine heavy and light chain CDRs are grafted into a fully human framework sequence.

The invention also includes functional equivalents of the antibodies described in this specification. Functional equivalents have binding characteristics that are comparable to those of the antibodies and include for example chimerized humanized and single chain antibodies as well as fragments thereof. Exemplary methods of producing such functional equivalents are disclosed in PCT Application WO 93 21319 European Patent Application No. 239 400 PCT Application WO 89 09622 European Patent Application 338 745 and European Patent Application EP 332 424 which are incorporated in their respective entireties by reference.

Functional equivalents include polypeptides with amino acid sequences substantially the same as the amino acid sequence of the variable or hypervariable regions of the antibodies of the invention. Substantially the same as applied to an amino acid sequence is defined herein as a sequence with at least about 90 and more preferably at least about 95 96 97 98 and 99 sequence identity to another amino acid sequence as determined by the FASTA search method in accordance with Pearson and Lipman Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 2444 2448 1988 .

Chimerized antibodies preferably have constant regions derived substantially or exclusively from human antibody constant regions and variable regions derived substantially or exclusively from the sequence of the variable region from a mammal other than a human. Humanized forms of the antibodies are made by substituting the complementarity determining regions of for example a mouse antibody into a human framework domain e.g. PCT Pub. No. WO92 22653. Humanized antibodies preferably have constant regions and variable regions other than the complementarity determining regions CDRs derived substantially or exclusively from the corresponding human antibody regions and CDRs derived substantially or exclusively from a mammal other than a human.

Functional equivalents also include single chain antibody fragments also known as single chain antibodies scFvs . These fragments contain at least one fragment of an antibody variable heavy chain amino acid sequence V tethered to at least one fragment of an antibody variable light chain sequence V with or without one or more interconnecting linkers. Such a linker may be a short flexible peptide selected to assure that the proper three dimensional folding of the V and V domains occurs once they are linked so as to maintain the target molecule binding specificity of the whole antibody from which the single chain antibody fragment is derived. Generally the carboxyl terminus of the V or V sequence may be covalently linked by such a peptide linker to the amino acid terminus of a complementary V and V sequence. Single chain antibody fragments may be generated by molecular cloning antibody phage display library or similar techniques. These proteins may be produced either in eukaryotic cells or prokaryotic cells including bacteria.

Single chain antibody fragments contain amino acid sequences having at least one of the variable or complementarity determining regions CDRs of the intact antibodies described in this specification but are lacking some or all of the constant domains of those antibodies. These constant domains are not necessary for antigen binding but constitute a major portion of the structure of intact antibodies. Single chain antibody fragments may therefore overcome some of the problems associated with the use of antibodies containing a part or all of a constant domain. For example single chain antibody fragments tend to be free of undesired interactions between biological molecules and the heavy chain constant region or other unwanted biological activity. Additionally single chain antibody fragments are considerably smaller than intact or whole antibodies and may therefore have greater capillary permeability than intact antibodies allowing single chain antibody fragments to localize and bind to target antigen binding sites more efficiently. Also antibody fragments can be produced on a relatively large scale in prokaryotic cells thus facilitating their production. Furthermore the relatively small size of single chain antibody fragments makes them less likely to provoke an immune response in a recipient than intact antibodies.

The knowledge of the amino acid and nucleic acid sequences for the anti CD20 antibody and its resurfaced or humanized variants which are described herein can be used to develop many antibodies which also bind to human CD20. Several studies have surveyed the effects of introducing one or more amino acid changes at various positions in the sequence of an antibody based on the knowledge of the primary antibody sequence on its properties such as binding and level of expression e.g. Yang W. P. et al. 1995254 392 403 Rader C. et al. 199895 8910 8915 Vaughan T. J. et al. 199816 535 539 .

In these studies variants of the primary antibody have been generated by changing the sequences of the heavy and light chain genes in the CDR1 CDR2 CDR3 or framework regions using methods such as oligonucleotide mediated site directed mutagenesis cassette mutagenesis error prone PCR DNA shuffling or mutator strains of Vaughan T. J. et al. 199816 535 539 Adey N. B. et al. 1996 Chapter 16 pp. 277 291 in Eds. Kay B. K. et al. Academic Press . These methods of changing the sequence of the primary antibody have resulted in improved affinities of the secondary antibodies e.g. Gram H. et al. 199289 3576 3580 Boder E. T. et al. 200097 10701 10705 Davies J. and Riechmann L. 19962 169 179 Thompson J. et al. 1996 256 77 88 Short M. K. et al. 2002277 16365 16370 Furukawa K. et al. 2001 276 27622 27628 .

By a similar directed strategy of changing one or more amino acid residues of the antibody the antibody sequences described in this invention can be used to develop anti CD20 antibodies with improved functions such as those methods described in patent application publication 20090246195 the contents of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.

The present invention is also directed to conjugates also referred to herein as immunoconjugates comprising the anti CD20 antibodies antibody fragments functional equivalents improved antibodies and their aspects as disclosed herein linked or conjugated to a drug or prodrug. Suitable drugs or prodrugs are known in the art. Preferred drugs or prodrugs are cytotoxic agents. The cytotoxic agent used in the cytotoxic conjugate of the present invention may be any compound that results in the death of a cell or induces cell death or in some manner decreases cell viability and includes for example maytansinoids and maytansinoid analogs benzodiazepines taxoids CC 1065 and CC 1065 analogs duocarmycins and duocarmycin analogs enediynes such as calicheamicins dolastatin and dolastatin analogs including auristatins tomaymycin derivatives leptomycin derivatives methotrexate cisplatin carboplatin daunorubicin doxorubicin vincristine vinblastine melphalan mitomycin C chlorambucil and morpholino doxorubicin. More preferred cytotoxic agents are maytansinoids and maytansinoids analogs benzodiazepines taxanes CC 1065 and CC 1065 analogs. Especially preferred are maytansinoids and maytansinoid analogs many of which are described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20070048314 20060233814 20080003652 20060155110 20060128970 20090182038 20090042837 20080233618 20080119558 20060099235 20050272727 20050203174 20050112726 20060182750 20090202536 20090142361 20080249085 20080226659 20080171865 20080171856 20080171040 20080145374 20080114153 20070270585 20070269447 20070264266 20070009541 20070009540 20070009539 20060167245 20060127407 20060084141 20050276812 20050169933 20050152913 20050113571 20050003513 20040241174 20040235840 20040120949 20040014980 20030157694 20020156318 20020156274 20020001587 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

Such conjugates can be prepared by using a linking group in order to link a drug or prodrug to the antibody or functional equivalent. Suitable linking groups are well known in the art and include for example disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups and esterase labile groups.

The drug or prodrug can for example be linked to the anti CD20 antibody or fragment thereof through a disulfide bond. The linker molecule or crosslinking agent comprises a reactive chemical group that can react with the anti CD20 antibody or fragment thereof. Preferred reactive chemical groups for reaction with the cell binding agent are N succinimidyl esters and N sulfosuccinimidyl esters. Additionally the linker molecule comprises a reactive chemical group preferably a dithiopyridyl group that can react with the drug to form a disulfide bond. Particularly preferred linker molecules include for example N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP see e.g. Carlsson et al. 173 723 737 1978 N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridyldithio butanoate SPDB see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 563 304 N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridyldithio 2 sulfobutanoate sulfo SPDB see US Publication No. 20090274713 N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridyldithio pentanoate SPP see e.g. CAS Registry number 341498 08 6 2 iminothiolane or acetylsuccinic anhydride and other reactive cross linkers such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 913 748 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference using known methods. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 563 304 Carlsson et al Biochem. J. 173 723 737 1978 Blattler et al Biochem. 24 1517 1524 1985 Lambert et al Biochem. 22 3913 3920 1983 Klotz et al Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 96 605 1962 and Liu et al Biochem. 18 690 1979 Blakey and Thorpe Antibody Immunoconjugates and Radiopharmaceuticals 1 1 16 1988 Worrell et al Anti Cancer Drug Design 1 179 184 1986 the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. For example the antibody or cell binding agent can be modified with crosslinking reagents and the antibody or cell binding agent containing free or protected thiol groups thus derived is then reacted with a disulfide or thiol containing maytansinoid to produce conjugates. The conjugates can be purified by chromatography including but not limited to HPLC size exclusion adsorption ion exchange and affinity capture dialysis or tangential flow filtration.

In another aspect of the present invention the anti CD20 antibody is linked to cytotoxic drugs via disulfide bonds and a polyethylene glycol spacer in enhancing the potency solubility or the efficacy of the immunoconjugate. Such cleavable hydrophilic linkers are described in WO2009 0134976. The additional benefit of this linker design is the desired high monomer ratio and the minimal aggregation of the antibody drug conjugate. Specifically contemplated in this aspect are conjugates of cell binding agents and drugs linked via disulfide group S S bearing polyethylene glycol spacers CHCHO with a narrow range of drug load of 2 8 are described that show relatively high potent biological activity toward cancer cells and have the desired biochemical properties of high conjugation yield and high monomer ratio with minimal protein aggregation.

Specifically contemplated in this aspect is an anti CD20 antibody drug conjugate of formula I or a conjugate of formula I CB X CH CHO Y D I D Y CH CHO X CB I 

Also more preferably n is an integer form 2 to 8. Alternatively as disclosed in for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 441 163 and 7 368 565 the drug can be first modified to introduce a reactive ester suitable to react with a cell binding agent. Reaction of these drugs containing an activated linker moiety with a cell binding agent provides another method of producing a cell binding agent drug conjugate. Maytansinoids may also be linked to anti CD20 antibody or fragment using PEG linking groups as set forth for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 716 821. These PEG non cleavable linking groups are soluble both in water and in non aqueous solvents and can be used to join one or more cytotoxic agents to a cell binding agent. Exemplary PEG linking groups include heterobifunctional PEG linkers that react with cytotoxic agents and cell binding agents at opposite ends of the linkers through a functional sulfhydryl or disulfide group at one end and an active ester at the other end. As a general example of the synthesis of a cytotoxic conjugate using a PEG linking group reference is again made to U.S. Pat. No. 6 716 821 which is incorporated entirely by reference herein. Synthesis begins with the reaction of one or more cytotoxic agents bearing a reactive PEG moiety with a cell binding agent resulting in displacement of the terminal active ester of each reactive PEG moiety by an amino acid residue of the cell binding agent to yield a cytotoxic conjugate comprising one or more cytotoxic agents covalently bonded to a cell binding agent through a PEG linking group. Alternatively the cell binding can be modified with the bifunctional PEG crosslinker to introduce a reactive disulfide moiety such as a pyridyldisulfide which can then be treated with a thiol containing maytansinoid to provide a conjugate. In another method the cell binding can be modified with the bifunctional PEG crosslinker to introduce a thiol moiety which can then can be treated with a reactive disulfide containing maytansinoid such as a pyridyldisulfide to provide a conjugate.

Antibody drug conjugates with non cleavable links can also be prepared. Such crosslinkers are described in the art see e.g. ThermoScientific Pierce Crosslinking Technical Handbook and US Publication No. 20050169933 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference and include but are not limited to N succinimidyl 4 maleimidomethyl cyclohexanecarboxylate SMCC N succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxy 6 amidocaproate which is a long chain analog of SMCC LC SMCC maleimidoundecanoic acid N succinimidyl ester KMUA maleimidopropanoic acid N succinimidyl ester BMPS maleimidobutyric acid N succinimidyl ester GMBS maleimidocaproic acid N hydroxysuccinimide ester EMCS m maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester MBS N maleimidoacetoxy succinimide ester AMAS succinimidyl 6 maleimidopropionamido hexanoate SMPH N succinimidyl 4 p maleimidophenyl butyrate SMPB and N p maleimidophenyl isocyanate PMPI N succinimidyl 4 iodoacetyl aminobenzoate SIAB N succinimidyl iodoacetate SIA N succinimidyl bromoacetate SBA and N succinimidyl 3 bromoacetamido propionate SBAP . Preferably the antibody is modified with crosslinking reagents such as succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC sulfo SMCC maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester MBS sulfo MBS or succinimidyl iodoacetate as described in the literature to introduce 1 10 reactive groups Yoshitake et al Eur. J. Biochem. 101 395 399 1979 Hashida et al J. Applied Biochem. 56 63 1984 and Liu et al Biochem. 18 690 697 1979 . The modified antibody is then reacted with the thiol containing maytansinoid derivative to produce a conjugate. The conjugate can be purified by gel filtration through a Sephadex G25 column or by dialysis or tangential flow filtration. The modified antibodies are treated with the thiol containing maytansinoid 1 to 2 molar equivalent maleimido group and antibody maytansinoid conjugates are purified by gel filtration through a Sephadex G 25 column chromatography on a ceramic hydroxyapatite column dialysis or tangential flow filtration or a combination of methods thereof. Typically an average of 1 10 maytansinoids per antibody are linked. A preferred method is to modify antibodies with succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC to introduce maleimido groups followed by reaction of the modified antibody with a thiol containing maytansinoid to give a thioether linked conjugate. Again conjugates with 1 to 10 drug molecules per antibody molecule result. Maytansinoid conjugates of antibodies antibody fragments protein hormones protein growth factors and other proteins are made in the same way.

In another aspect of the invention the CD20 antibody is linked to the drug via a non cleavable bond through the intermediacy of a PEG spacer. Suitable crosslinking reagents comprising hydrophilic PEG chains that form linkers between a drug and the anti CD20 antibody or fragment are also well known in the art or are commercially available for example from Quanta Biodesign Powell Ohio . Suitable PEG containing crosslinkers can also be synthesized from commercially available PEGs themselves using standard synthetic chemistry techniques known to one skilled in the art. The drugs can be reacted with bifunctional PEG containing cross linkers to give compounds of the following formula Z X CH CH O Y D by methods described in detail in US Patent Publication 20090274713 and in WO2009 0134976 which can then react with the cell binding agent to provide a conjugate. Alternatively the cell binding can be modified with the bifunctional PEG crosslinker to introduce a thiol reactive group such as a maleimide or haloacetamide which can then be treated with a thiol containing maytansinoid to provide a conjugate. In another method the cell binding can be modified with the bifunctional PEG crosslinker to introduce a thiol moiety which can then be treated with a thiol reactive maytansinoid such as a maytansinoid bearing a maleimide or haloacetamide to provide a conjugate.

Accordingly another aspect of the present invention is an anti CD20 antibody drug conjugate of formula II or of formula II CB X CH CH O Y D II D Y CH CH O X CB II 

Also more preferably n is an integer from 2 to 8. Examples of suitable PEG containing linkers include linkers having an N succinimidyl ester or N sulfosuccinimidyl ester moiety for reaction with the anti CD20 antibody or fragment thereof as well as a maleimido or haloacetyl based moiety for reaction with the compound. A PEG spacer can be incorporated into any crosslinker known in the art by the methods described herein. Crosslinking reagents comprising a maleimido based moiety that can be incorporated with a PEG spacer include but are not limited to N succinimidyl 4 maleimidomethyl cyclohexanecarboxylate SMCC N succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxy 6 amidocaproate which is a long chain analog of SMCC LC SMCC maleimidoundecanoic acid N succinimidyl ester KMUA maleimidobutyric acid N succinimidyl ester GMBS 8 maleimidocaproic acid N hydroxysuccinimide ester EMCS m maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester MBS N maleimidoacetoxy succinimide ester AMAS succinimidyl 6 maleimidopropionamido hexanoate SMPH N succinimidyl 4 p maleimidophenyl butyrate SMPB and N p maleimidophenyl isocyanate PMPI . Cross linking reagents comprising a haloacetyl based moiety include N succinimidyl 4 iodoacetyl aminobenzoate SIAB N succinimidyl iodoacetate SIA N succinimidyl bromoacetate SBA and N succinimidyl 3 bromoacetamido propionate SBAP .

Other crosslinking reagents lacking a sulfur atom can also be used. Such linkers can be derived from dicarboxylic acid based moieties. Suitable dicarboxylic acid based moieties include but are not limited to dicarboxylic acids of the general formula shown below HOOC A E CHCHO G COOH wherein A is an optional linear or branched alkyl alkenyl or alkynyl group having 2 to 20 carbon atoms E is an optional cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms G is an optional substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group having 6 to 10 carbon atoms or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group wherein the hetero atom is selected from N O or S and wherein p q and r are each 0 or 1 provided that p q and r are all not zero at the same time n is an integer from 1 to 2000.

Many of the linkers disclosed herein are described in detail in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20050169933 and 20090274713 and in WO2009 0134976 the contents of which are entirely incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention also provides charged linkers wherein the charges are retained both after modification of the anti CD20 antibody or fragment thereof and in the resulting drug conjugate. More specifically the present invention relates to the use of charged linkers to link drugs to an anti CD20 antibody. In one aspect of the invention the charged linkers are used to modify cell binding agents and link them to drugs. In another aspect of the invention the charged linkers are used to modify drugs and link them to the anti CD20 antibody or fragment. In yet another aspect of the invention the charged linkers are used to simultaneously link drugs and the cell binding agents. In all instances the preferred end result is a drug charged linker cell binding agent conjugate which can be represented by the formula CB L D wherein CB is a cell binding agent that is an anti CD20 antibody or fragment thereof Lis a charged linker D is a drug molecule and q is an integer from 1 to 20. The presence of a charged group s in the linker in the cell binding agent drug conjugate provides several advantages such as i greater water solubility of the final product ii ability to operate at a higher concentration in aqueous solutions iii ability to link a greater number of drug molecules per molecule of cell binding agent resulting in higher potency iv potential for the charged conjugate species to be retained inside the target cell resulting in higher potency and v improved sensitivity of multidrug resistant cells which would be unable to export the charged drug species from the cell. The invention also describes linkers which can be coupled to a drug and a cell binding agent to give a conjugate which can be metabolized in a cell to produce a drug metabolite containing one or more charged moieties. These linkers will be referred to as pro charged linkers. Moieties of the linker which will become charged after cell processing will be referred to as pro charged moieties.

The present invention includes aspects wherein about 2 to about 8 drug molecules drug load for example maytansinoid are linked to an anti CD20 antibody or fragment thereof the anti tumor effect of the conjugate is much more efficacious as compared to a drug load of a lesser or higher number of drugs linked to the same cell binding agent. Drug load as used herein refers to the number of drug molecules e.g. a maytansinoid that can be attached to a cell binding agent e.g. an anti CD20 antibody or fragment thereof .

The anti CD20 antibody or fragment thereof can be modified by reacting a bifunctional crosslinking reagent with the anti CD20 antibody or fragment thereof thereby resulting in the covalent attachment of a linker molecule to the anti CD20 antibody or fragment thereof. As used herein a bifunctional crosslinking reagent is any chemical moiety that covalently links a cell binding agent to a drug such as the drugs described herein. In another method a portion of the linking moiety is provided by the drug. In this respect the drug comprises a linking moiety that is part of a larger linker molecule that is used to join the cell binding agent to the drug. For example to form the maytansinoid DM1 the side chain at the C 3 hydroxyl group of maytansine is modified to have a free sulfhydryl group SH . This thiolated form of maytansine can react with a modified cell binding agent to form a conjugate. Therefore the final linker is assembled from two components one of which is provided by the crosslinking reagent while the other is provided by the side chain from DM1.

The drug molecules can also be linked to the antibody molecules through an intermediary carrier molecule such as serum albumin.

As used herein the expression linked to a cell binding agent or linked to an anti CD20 antibody or fragment refers to the conjugate molecule comprising at least one drug derivative bound to a cell binding agent anti CD20 antibody or fragment via a suitable linking group or a precursor thereof.

In general a solution of an antibody in aqueous buffer may be incubated with a molar excess of maytansinoids having a disulfide moiety that bears a reactive group. The reaction mixture can be quenched by addition of excess amine such as ethanolamine taurine etc. . The maytansinoid antibody conjugate may then be purified by gel filtration.

Conjugates of antibodies with maytansinoid drugs can be evaluated for their ability to suppress proliferation of various unwanted cell lines in vitro. For example cell lines such as the human lymphoma cell line Daudi and the human lymphoma cell line Ramos can easily be used for the assessment of cytotoxicity of these compounds. Cells to be evaluated can be exposed to the compounds for 4 to 5 days and the surviving fractions of cells measured in direct assays by known methods. ICvalues can then be calculated from the results of the assays.

The cytotoxic agent used in the cytotoxic conjugates according to the present invention may also be a taxane or derivative thereof. Taxanes are a family of compounds that includes paclitaxel Taxol a cytotoxic natural product and docetaxel Taxotere a semi synthetic derivative two compounds that are widely used in the treatment of cancer. Taxanes are mitotic spindle poisons that inhibit the depolymerization of tubulin resulting in cell death. While docetaxel and paclitaxel are useful agents in the treatment of cancer their antitumor activity is limited because of their non specific toxicity towards normal cells. Further compounds like paclitaxel and docetaxel themselves are not sufficiently potent to be used in conjugates of cell binding agents such as the anti CD20 antibodies and fragments thereof of the present invention. Taxanes suitable for use in the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 372 738 and 6 340 701. Conjugates of the taxanes of the invention and a cell binding agent can be formed using any techniques presently known or later developed. Numerous methods of conjugation are taught in U.S. Pat.

In another aspect of the invention siRNA molecules can be linked to the antibodies of the present invention instead of a drug. siRNAs can be linked to the antibodies of the present invention by methods commonly used for the modification of oligonucleotides see for example US Patent Publications 20050107325 and 20070213292 . Thus the siRNA in its 3 or 5 phosphoromidite form can be reacted with one end of the crosslinker bearing a hydroxyl functionality to give an ester bond between the siRNA and the crosslinker. Similarly reaction of the siRNA phosphoramidite with a crosslinker bearing a terminal amino group results in linkage of the crosslinker to the siRNA through an amine. Alternatively the siRNA can be derivatized by standard chemical methods to introduce a thiol group. This thiol containing siRNA can be reacted with an antibody that has been modified to introduce an active disulfide or maleimide moiety to produce a cleavable or non cleavable conjugate. Between 1 20 siRNA molecules can be linked to an antibody by this method.

In addition to the therapeutic uses of the antibodies discussed herein the antibodies and or fragments of the present invention can be employed in many known diagnostic and research applications. Antibodies and or fragments of the present invention may be used for example in the purification detection and targeting of CD20 included in both in vitro and in vivo diagnostic methods. For example the antibodies and or fragments may be used in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of CD20 expressed by cells in biological samples. See e.g. Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The antibodies of the present invention may be used in for example competitive binding assays direct and indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays Zola Monoclonal Antibodies A Manual of Techniques pp. 147 158 CRC Press Inc. 1987 .

For example the present invention also provides the above anti CD20 peptides and antibodies detectably labeled as described below for use in diagnostic methods for detecting CD20 in patients known to be or suspected of having a CD20 mediated condition. Anti CD20 peptides and or antibodies of the present invention are useful for immunoassays which detect or quantitate CD20 or anti CD20 antibodies in a sample. An immunoassay for CD20 typically comprises incubating a biological sample in the presence of a detectably labeled high affinity anti CD20 peptide and or antibody of the present invention capable of selectively binding to CD20 and detecting the labeled peptide or antibody which is bound in a sample. Various clinical assay procedures are well known in the art e.g. as described in Immunoassays for the 80 s A. Voller et al. eds. University Park 1981. Thus an anti CD20 peptide or antibody or fragment thereof can be added to nitrocellulose or another solid support which is capable of immobilizing cells cell particles or soluble proteins. The support can then be washed with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled CD20 specific peptide or antibody or fragment thereof. The solid phase support can then be washed with the buffer a second time to remove unbound peptide or antibody or fragment thereof. The amount of bound label on the solid support can then be detected by known method steps.

By solid phase support or carrier is intended any support capable of binding peptide antigen or antibody or fragment thereof. Well known supports or carriers include glass polystyrene polypropylene polyethylene dextran nylon amylases natural and modified celluloses polyacrylamides agaroses and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble to some extent or insoluble for the purposes of the present invention. The support material can have virtually any possible structural configuration so long as the coupled molecule is capable of binding to CD20 or an anti CD20 antibody or fragment thereof. Thus the support configuration can be spherical as in a bead or cylindrical as in the inside surface of a test tube or the external surface of a rod. Alternatively the surface can be flat such as a sheet culture dish test strip etc. Preferred supports include polystyrene beads. Those skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody or fragment thereof peptide or antigen or can ascertain the same by routine experimentation.

Well known method steps can determine binding activity of a given lot of anti CD20 peptide and or antibody or fragment thereof. Those skilled in the art can determine operative and optimal assay conditions by routine experimentation.

Detectably labeling a CD20 specific peptide and or antibody or fragment thereof can be accomplished by linking to an enzyme for use in an enzyme immunoassay EIA or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA . The linked enzyme reacts with the exposed substrate to generate a chemical moiety which can be detected for example by spectrophotometric fluorometric or by visual means. Enzymes which can be used to detectably label the CD20 specific antibodies or fragment thereof of the present invention include but are not limited to malate dehydrogenase staphylococcal nuclease delta 5 steroid isomerase yeast alcohol dehydrogenase alpha glycerophosphate dehydrogenase triose phosphate isomerase horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase asparaginase glucose oxidase beta galactosidase ribonuclease urease catalase glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase glucoamylase and acetylcholinesterase.

By radioactively labeling the CD20 specific antibodies and or fragment thereof it is possible to detect CD20 through the use of a radioimmunoassay RIA see for example Work et al. Laboratory Techniques and Biochemistry in Molecular Biology North Holland Publishing Company N.Y. 1978 . The radioactive isotope can be detected by such means as the use of a gamma counter or a scintillation counter or by autoradiography. Isotopes which are particularly useful for the purpose of the present invention are H I I S C and preferably I.

It is also possible to label the CD20 specific antibodies and or fragments thereof with a fluorescent compound. When the fluorescent labeled antibody is exposed to light of the proper wave length its presence can then be detected due to fluorescence. Among the most commonly used fluorescent labelling compounds are fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine phycoerythrin phycocyanin allophycocyanin o phthaldehyde and fluorescamine.

The CD20 specific antibodies or fragments thereof can also be detectably labeled using fluorescence emitting metals such as Eu or others of the lanthanide series. These metals can be attached to the CD20 specific antibody or fragment thereof using such metal chelating groups as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid DTPA or ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid EDTA .

The CD20 specific antibodies or fragments thereof also can be detectably labeled by coupling to a chemiluminescent compound. The presence of the chemiluminescently labeled antibody is then determined by detecting the presence of luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of particularly useful chemiluminescent labeling compounds are luminol isoluminol theromatic acridinium ester imidazole acridinium salt and oxalate ester. Likewise a bioluminescent compound can be used to label the CD20 specific antibody fragment or derivative thereof of the present invention. Bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence found in biological systems in which a catalytic protein increases the efficiency of the chemiluminescent reaction. The presence of a bioluminescent protein is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence. Important bioluminescent compounds for purposes of labeling are luciferin luciferase and aequorin.

Detection of the CD20 specific antibody fragment or derivative thereof can be accomplished by a scintillation counter for example if the detectable label is a radioactive gamma emitter or by a fluorometer for example if the label is a fluorescent material. In the case of an enzyme label the detection can be accomplished by colorometric methods which employ a substrate for the enzyme. Detection can also be accomplished by visual comparison of the extent of enzymatic reaction of a substrate in comparison with similarly prepared standards.

For the purposes of the present invention the CD20 which is detected by the above assays can be present in a biological sample. Any sample containing CD20 can be used. Preferably the sample is a biological fluid such as for example blood serum lymph urine inflammatory exudate cerebrospinal fluid amniotic fluid a tissue extract or homogenate and the like. However the invention is not limited to assays using only these samples it being possible for one of ordinary skill in the art to determine suitable conditions which allow the use of other samples.

In situ detection can be accomplished by removing a histological specimen from a patient and providing the combination of labeled antibodies of the present invention to such a specimen. The antibody or fragment thereof is preferably provided by applying or by overlaying the labeled antibody or fragment thereof to a biological sample. Through the use of such a procedure it is possible to determine not only the presence of CD20 but also the distribution of CD20 in the examined tissue. Using the present invention those of ordinary skill will readily perceive that any of a wide variety of histological methods such as staining procedures can be modified in order to achieve such in situ detection.

The antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention can be adapted for utilization in an immunometric assay also known as a two site or sandwich assay. In a typical immunometric assay a quantity of unlabeled antibody or fragment thereof is bound to a solid support that is insoluble in the fluid being tested and a quantity of detectably labeled soluble antibody is added to permit detection and or quantitation of the ternary complex formed between solid phase antibody antigen and labeled antibody.

Typical and preferred immunometric assays include forward assays in which the antibody bound to the solid phase is first contacted with the sample being tested to extract the CD20 from the sample by formation of a binary solid phase antibody CD20 complex. After a suitable incubation period the solid support is washed to remove the residue of the fluid sample including unreacted CD20 if any and then contacted with the solution containing a known quantity of labeled antibody which functions as a reporter molecule . After a second incubation period to permit the labeled antibody to complex with the CD20 bound to the solid support through the unlabeled antibody or fragment thereof the solid support is washed a second time to remove the unreacted labeled antibody or fragment thereof. This type of forward sandwich assay can be a simple yes no assay to determine whether CD20 is present or can be made quantitative by comparing the measure of labeled antibody or fragment thereof with that obtained for a standard sample containing known quantities of CD20. Such two site or sandwich assays are described by Wide Radioimmune Assay Method Kirkham ed. Livingstone Edinburgh 1970 pp. 199 206 .

Other type of sandwich assays which can also be useful with CD20 are the so called simultaneous and reverse assays. A simultaneous assay involves a single incubation step wherein the antibody bound to the solid support and labeled antibody are both added to the sample being tested at the same time. After the incubation is completed the solid support is washed to remove the residue of fluid sample and uncomplexed labeled antibody. The presence of labeled antibody associated with the solid support is then determined as it would be in a conventional forward sandwich assay.

In the reverse assay stepwise addition first of a solution of labeled antibody to the fluid sample followed by the addition of unlabeled antibody bound to a solid support after a suitable incubation period is utilized. After a second incubation the solid phase is washed in conventional fashion to free it of the residue of the sample being tested and the solution of unreacted labeled antibody. The determination of labeled antibody associated with a solid support is then determined as in the simultaneous and forward assays. In one aspect a combination of antibodies of the present invention specific for separate epitopes can be used to construct a sensitive three site immunoradiometric assay.

The antibodies or fragments thereof of the invention also are useful for in vivo imaging wherein an antibody or fragment thereof labeled with a detectable moiety such as a radio opaque agent or radioisotope is administered to a subject preferably into the bloodstream and the presence and location of the labeled antibody in the host is assayed. This imaging technique is useful in the staging and treatment of malignancies. The antibody or fragment thereof may be labeled with any moiety that is detectable in a host whether by nuclear magnetic resonance radiology or other detection means known in the art.

The label can be any detectable moiety that is capable of producing either directly or indirectly a detectable signal. For example the label may be a biotin label an enzyme label e.g. luciferase alkaline phosphatase beta galactosidase and horseradish peroxidase a radiolabel e.g. H C P S and I a fluorophore such as fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound e.g. fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine an imaging agent e.g. Tc m99 and indium In and a metal ion e.g. gallium and europium .

Any method known in the art for conjugating the antibody or fragment thereof to the label may be employed including those exemplary methods described by Hunter et al. 1962 144 945 David et al. 197413 1014 Pain et al. 198140 219 Nygren J. 198230 407.

The antibodies or fragments thereof of the invention also are useful as reagents in biological research based on their inhibition of the function of CD20 in cells.

The antibodies or fragments thereof of the invention also are useful as affinity purification agents. In this process the antibodies for example are immobilized on a suitable support such a Sephadex resin or filter paper using methods well known in the art. Thus CD20 may be isolated and purified from a biological sample.

The present invention further provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody or fragment thereof of the invention or epitope binding fragments thereof.

The present invention also encompasses polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide that can bind CD20 and that hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions to polynucleotides that encode an antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention wherein said stringent hybridization conditions include pre hybridization for 2 hours at 60 C. in 6 SSC 0.5 SDS 5 Denhardt s solution and 100 g ml heat denatured salmon sperm DNA hybridization for 18 hours at 60 C. washing twice in 4 SSC 0.5 SDS 0.1 sodium pyrophosphate for 30 min at 60 C. and twice in 2 SSC 0.1 SDS for 30 min at 60 C.

The polynucleotides may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined by any method known in the art. For example using the nucleotide sequence of the antibody or fragment thereof set forth herein a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. 199417 242 which briefly involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligation of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.

Methods for the construction of recombinant vectors containing anti CD20 antibody or fragment coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals are well known in the art. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention thus provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the present invention or a heavy or light chain thereof or a heavy or light chain variable domain or an epitope binding fragment of any of these operably linked to a promoter.

The recombinant vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention or an epitope binding fragment thereof operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred aspects vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co expressed in the host cell for expression of an entire immunoglobulin molecule.

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the anti CD20 antibody or fragment molecules of the invention. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells which may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing antibody coding sequences plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing antibody coding sequences or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 3T3 cells harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter .

Preferably bacterial cells such as and more preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies Foecking et al. 1986 Gene 45 101 Cockett et al. 1990 Bio Technology 8 2 .

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.

Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been recombinantly expressed it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In this regard U.S. Pat. No. 7 538 195 has been referred to in the present disclosure the teachings of which are hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.

In another aspect diverse antibodies and antibody fragments as well as antibody mimics may be readily produced by mutation deletion and or insertion within the variable and constant region sequences that flank a particular set of CDRs using methods as disclosed herein or known in the art. Thus for example different classes of Ab are possible for a given set of CDRs by substitution of different heavy chains whereby for example IgG1 4 IgM IgA1 2 IgD IgE antibody types and isotypes may be produced. Similarly artificial antibodies within the scope of the invention may be produced by embedding a given set of CDRs within an entirely synthetic framework. The term variable is used herein to describe certain portions of the variable domains that differ in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its antigen. However the variability is not usually evenly distributed through the variable domains of the antibodies. It is typically concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions CDRs or hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework FR . The variable domains of heavy and light chains each comprise four framework regions largely adopting a beta sheet configuration connected by three CDRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the beta sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies E. A. Kabat et al. fifth edition 1991 NIH . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

Humanized antibodies or antibodies adapted for non rejection by other mammals may be produced using several technologies such as resurfacing and CDR grafting. In the resurfacing technology molecular modeling statistical analysis and mutagenesis are combined to adjust the non CDR surfaces of variable regions to resemble the surfaces of known antibodies of the target host. Strategies and methods for the resurfacing of antibodies and other methods for reducing immunogenicity of antibodies within a different host are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 641 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference. In the CDR grafting technology the murine heavy and light chain CDRs are grafted into a fully human framework sequence.

The invention also includes functional equivalents of the antibodies described in this specification. Functional equivalents have binding characteristics that are comparable to those of the antibodies and include for example chimerized humanized and single chain antibodies as well as fragments thereof. Methods of producing such functional equivalents are disclosed in PCT Application WO 93 21319 European Patent Application No. 239 400 PCT Application WO 89 09622 European Patent Application 338 745 and European Patent Application EP 332 424 which are incorporated in their respective entireties by reference.

Functional equivalents include polypeptides with amino acid sequences substantially the same as the amino acid sequence of the variable or hypervariable regions of the antibodies of the invention. Substantially the same as applied to an amino acid sequence is defined herein as a sequence with at least about 90 and more preferably at least about 95 sequence identity to another amino acid sequence as determined by the FASTA search method in accordance with Pearson and Lipman Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 2444 2448 1988 .

Chimerized antibodies preferably have constant regions derived substantially or exclusively from human antibody constant regions and variable regions derived substantially or exclusively from the sequence of the variable region from a mammal other than a human. Humanized forms of the antibodies are made by substituting the complementarity determining regions of for example a mouse antibody into a human framework domain e.g. see PCT Pub. No. WO92 22653. Humanized antibodies preferably have constant regions and variable regions other than the complementarity determining regions CDRs derived substantially or exclusively from the corresponding human antibody regions and CDRs derived substantially or exclusively from a mammal other than a human.

Functional equivalents also include single chain antibody fragments also known as single chain antibodies scFvs . These fragments contain at least one fragment of an antibody variable heavy chain amino acid sequence V tethered to at least one fragment of an antibody variable light chain sequence V with or without one or more interconnecting linkers. Such a linker may be a short flexible peptide selected to assure that the proper three dimensional folding of the V and V domains occurs once they are linked so as to maintain the target molecule binding specificity of the whole antibody from which the single chain antibody fragment is derived. Generally the carboxyl terminus of the V or V sequence may be covalently linked by such a peptide linker to the amino acid terminus of a complementary V and V sequence. Single chain antibody fragments may be generated by molecular cloning antibody phage display library or similar techniques. These proteins may be produced either in eukaryotic cells or prokaryotic cells including bacteria.

Single chain antibody fragments contain amino acid sequences having at least one of the variable or complementarity determining regions CDRs of the whole antibodies described in this specification but are lacking some or all of the constant domains of those antibodies. These constant domains are not necessary for antigen binding but constitute a major portion of the structure of whole antibodies. Single chain antibody fragments may therefore overcome some of the problems associated with the use of antibodies containing a part or all of a constant domain. For example single chain antibody fragments tend to be free of undesired interactions between biological molecules and the heavy chain constant region or other unwanted biological activity. Additionally single chain antibody fragments are considerably smaller than whole antibodies and may therefore have greater capillary permeability than whole antibodies allowing single chain antibody fragments to localize and bind to target antigen binding sites more efficiently. Also antibody fragments can be produced on a relatively large scale in prokaryotic cells thus facilitating their production. Furthermore the relatively small size of single chain antibody fragments makes them less likely to provoke an immune response in a recipient than whole antibodies.

The knowledge of the amino acid and nucleic acid sequences for the anti CD20 antibody and its humanized variants which are described herein can be used to develop other antibodies which also bind to human CD20. Several studies have surveyed the effects of introducing one or more amino acid changes at various positions in the sequence of an antibody based on the knowledge of the primary antibody sequence on its properties such as binding and level of expression Yang W. P. et al. 1995254 392 403 Rader C. et al. 199895 8910 8915 Vaughan T. J. et al. 199816 535 539 .

In these studies variants of the primary antibody have been generated by changing the sequences of the heavy and light chain genes in the CDR1 CDR2 CDR3 or framework regions using methods such as oligonucleotide mediated site directed mutagenesis cassette mutagenesis error prone PCR DNA shuffling or mutator strains of Vaughan T. J. et al. 199816 535 539 Adey N. B. et al. 1996 Chapter 16 pp. 277 291 in Eds. Kay B. K. et al. Academic Press . These methods of changing the sequence of the primary antibody have resulted in improved affinities of the secondary antibodies Gram H. et al. 199289 3576 3580 Boder E. T. et al. 200097 10701 10705 Davies J. and Riechmann L. 19962 169 179 Thompson J. et al. 1996256 77 88 Short M. K. et al. 2002277 16365 16370 Furukawa K. et al. 2001276 27622 27628 .

By a similar directed strategy of changing one or more amino acid residues of the antibody the antibody sequences described in this invention can be used to develop anti CD20 antibodies with improved functions such as those methods described in patent application publication 20090246195 the contents of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.

Any method known in the art for conjugating the antibody to the detectable moiety may be employed including those methods described by Hunter et al. Nature 144 945 1962 David et al. Biochemistry 13 1014 1974 Pain et al. J. Immunol. Meth. 40 219 1981 and Nygren J. Histochem. and Cytochem. 30 407 1982 .

The antibodies of the present invention can be employed in any known assay method such as competitive binding assays direct and indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays Zola Monoclonal Antibodies A Manual of Techniques pp. 147 158 CRC Press Inc. 1987 .

The antibodies of the invention also are useful for in vivo imaging wherein an antibody labeled with a detectable moiety such as a radio opaque agent or radioisotope is administered to a subject preferably into the bloodstream and the presence and location of the labeled antibody in the host is assayed. This imaging technique is useful in the staging and treatment of malignancies. The antibody may be labeled with any moiety that is detectable in a host whether by nuclear magnetic resonance radiology or other detection means known in the art.

The antibodies of the invention also are useful as affinity purification agents. In this process the antibodies are immobilized on a suitable support such a Sephadex resin or filter paper using methods well known in the art.

Also included in the present invention are methods for inhibiting the growth of cells expressing CD20. These methods make use of the antibodies or fragments or conjugates of the present invention as well as the antibodies or fragments or immunoconjugates of the present invention in conjunction with one or more additional therapeutic agents. Suitable therapeutic agents include those that inhibit the growth of a cell expressing CD20 directly or indirectly.

As used herein the terms inhibit and inhibiting should be understood to include any inhibitory effect on cell growth including cell death. The inhibitory effects include temporary effects sustained effects and permanent effects.

The therapeutic applications of the present invention include methods of treating a subject having a disease. The diseases treated with the methods of the present invention are those characterized by the expression of CD20. Such diseases include B cell derived malignancies such non Hodgkin s lymphoma B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as non malignant autoimmune or inflammatory disorders including RA in which CD20 positive B cells play a role in disease pathophysiology. The skilled artisan will understand that the methods of the present invention may also be used to treat other diseases yet to be described but characterized by the expression of CD20.

Examples of in vitro uses include the purification of cell populations contaminated with CD20 positive cells such as cells of B cell lineage. The method comprises culturing the cell populations in the presence of a cytotoxic huCD20 7 conjugate and then removal of dead CD20 positive cells. The conditions for non clinical in vitro use are well known see e.g. Uckun et al. 1986163 347 368 Uckun et al. 1985134 3504 3515 Ramakrishnan et al. 1985135 3616 3622 .

The antibodies fragments and regions fragments or derivatives of this invention attached to a solid support can also be used to remove CD20 from fluids or tissue or cell extracts. In a preferred aspect they are used to remove CD20 from blood or blood plasma products. In another preferred aspect the murine and chimeric antibodies fragments and regions are advantageously used in extracorporeal immunoadsorbent devices which are known in the art see for example Seminars in Hematology 26 2 Suppl. 1 1989 . Patient blood or other body fluid is exposed to the attached antibody resulting in partial or complete removal of circulating CD20 free or in immune complexes following which the fluid is returned to the body. This immunoadsorption can be implemented in a continuous flow arrangement with or without interposing a cell centrifugation step. See for example Terman et al. J. Immunol. 11 7 1971 1975 1976 .

The present invention also includes therapeutic applications of the antibodies or conjugates of the present invention wherein the antibodies or conjugates may be administered to a subject in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. They can be administered intravenously as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time by intramuscular subcutaneous intra articular intrasynovial intrathecal oral topical or inhalation routes. They may also be administered by intratumoral peritumoral intralesional or perilesional routes to exert local as well as systemic therapeutic effects.

For therapeutic applications the antibodies or conjugates of the invention are administered to a subject in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. They can be administered intravenously as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time by intramuscular subcutaneous intra articular intrasynovial intrathecal oral topical or inhalation routes. The antibodies or conjugates may also be administered by intratumoral peritumoral intralesional or perilesional routes to exert local as well as systemic therapeutic effects. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers diluents and excipients are well known and can be determined by those of skill in the art as the clinical situation warrants. Examples of suitable carriers diluents and or excipients include 1 Dulbecco s phosphate buffered saline pH about 7.4 containing about 1 mg ml to 25 mg ml human serum albumin 2 0.9 saline 0.9 w v NaCl 3 5 w v dextrose and 4 10 mM histidine sulfate pH5.8 6 sucrose 0.02 polysorbate 20.

When present in an aqueous dosage form rather than being lyophilized the antibody or conjugate typically will be formulated at a concentration of about 0.1 mg ml to 100 mg ml although wide variation outside of these ranges is permitted. For the treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of antibody or fragment or conjugate will depend on the type of disease to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the disease whether the antibodies or conjugates are administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes the course of previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the treatment and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody or fragment or conjugate is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.

Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 0.015 to 25 mg of antibody or conjugate per kg of patient weight is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is repeated until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However other dosage regimens may be useful and are not excluded.

All such devices can use of formulations suitable for the administration for the dispensing of antibody in an aerosol. Such aerosols can be comprised of either solutions both aqueous and non aqueous or solid particles. Metered dose inhalers like the Ventolin metered dose inhaler typically use a propellent gas and require actuation during inspiration See e.g. WO 94 16970 WO 98 35888 . Dry powder inhalers like Turbuhaler Astra Rotahaler Glaxo Diskus Glaxo Spiros inhaler Dura devices marketed by Inhale Therapeutics and the Spinhaler powder inhaler Fisons use breath actuation of a mixed powder U.S. Pat.

An expression plasmid pSRa CD20 was constructed that contained the entire CD20 coding sequence CDS flanked by XbaI and BamHI restriction sites that allowed expression of human CD20 GI 23110989 . 300 19 cells a pre B cell line derived from a Balb c mouse Reth et al. 317 353 355 1985 was transfected with this expression plasmid to stably express high levels of human CD20 on the cell surface and used for immunization of Balb c VAF mice. Mice were subcutaneously immunized with approximately 5 10CD20 expressing 300 19 cells per mouse every 2 3 weeks by standard immunization protocols known to those of skill for example such as those used at ImmunoGen Inc. Immunized mice were boosted with antigen three days before being sacrificed for hybridoma generation. Spleens from mice was collected according to standard animal protocols such as for example grinding tissue between two sterile frosted microscopic slides to obtain a single cell suspension in RPMI 1640 medium. The spleen cells were centrifuged pelleted washed and fused with a murine myeloma such as for example P3X63Ag8.653 cells Kearney et al. J. Immunol. 123 1548 1550 1979 using polyethylene glycol 1500 Roche 783 641 . The fused cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 selection medium containing hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine HAT Sigma H 0262 and selected for growth in 96 well flat bottomed culture plates Corning Costar 3596 200A of cell suspension per well at 37 C. with 5 CO. After 5 days of incubation 100 L of culture supernatant were removed from each well and replaced with 100 L of RPMI 1640 medium containing hypoxanthine thymidine HT supplement Sigma H 0137 . Incubation at 37 C. with 5 COwas continued until hydridoma clones were ready for antibody screening. Other techniques of immunization and hybridoma production can also be used including those described in Langone et al. Eds. Immunochemical Techniques Part I Academic Press volume 121 Florida and Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press New York 1988 .

Culture supernatants from the hybridoma were screened by flow cytometry for secretion of mouse monoclonal antibodies that bind to CD20 expressing cells such as CD20 expressing 300 19 cells but not to the non transfected 300 19 cells. 100 l of hybridoma supernatants was incubated for 3 h with either CD20 expressing 300 19 cells or the non transfected 300 19 cells 1 10cells per sample in 100 L FACS buffer RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 normal goat serum . Then the cells were centrifuged pelleted washed and incubated for 1 h with 100 L of PE conjugated goat anti mouse IgG antibody such as obtainable from for example Jackson Laboratory 6 g mL in FACS buffer . The cells were centrifuged pelleted again washed with FACS buffer and resuspended in 200 L of PBS containing 1 formaldehyde. Cells were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with the HTS multiwell sampler or a FACS array flow cytometer and analyzed using CellQuest Pro all from BD Biosciences San Diego US .

Positive hybridoma clones were subcloned by limiting dilution. One subclone from each hybridoma which showed the same reactivity against CD20 as the parental cells by flow cytometry was chosen for subsequent analysis. Stable subclones were cultured and the isotype of each secreted anti CD20 antibody was identified using commercial isotyping reagents Roche 1493027 .

Antibodies were purified from hybridoma subclone supernatants using standard methods such as for example Protein A or G chromatography HiTrap Protein A or G HP 1 mL Amersham Biosciences . Briefly supernatant was prepared for chromatography by the addition of 1 10 volume of 1 M Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0. The pH adjusted supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 m filter membrane and loaded onto column equilibrated with binding buffer PBS pH 7.3 . The column was washed with binding buffer until a stable baseline was obtained with no absorbance at 280 nm. Antibody was eluted with 0.1 M acetic acid buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl pH 2.8 using a flow rate of 0.5 mL min. Fractions of approximately 0.25 mL were collected and neutralized by the addition of 1 10 volume of 1M Tris HCl pH 8.0. The peak fraction s was dialyzed overnight twice against 1 PBS and sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 m filter membrane. Purified antibody was quantified by absorbance at A280.

Protein A purified fractions were further polished using ion exchange chromatography IEX with quaternary ammonium O chromatography for murine antibodies. Briefly samples from protein A purification were buffer exchanged into binding buffer 10 mM Tris 10 mM sodium chloride pH 8.0 and filtered through 0.22 m filer. The prepared sample was then loaded onto a Q fast flow resin GE Lifesciences that was equilibrated with binding buffer at a flow rate of 120 cm hr. Column size was chosen to have sufficient capacity to bind all the MAb in the sample. The column was then washed with binding buffer until a stable baseline was obtained with no absorbance at 280 nm. Antibody was eluted by initiating a gradient from 10 mM to 500 mM sodium chloride in 20 column volume CV . Peak fractions were collected based on absorbance measurement at 280 nm A280 . The percentage of monomer was assessed with size exclusion chromatography SEC on a TSK gel G3000SWXL 7.8 300 mm with a SWXL guard column 6.0 40 mm Tosoh Bioscience Montgomeryville Pa. using an Agilent HPLC 1100 system Agilent Santa Clara Calif. . Fractions with monomer content above 95 were pooled buffer exchanged to PBS pH 7.4 using a TFF system and sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 m filter membrane. The IgG concentration of purified antibody was determined by A280 using an extinction coefficient of 1.47. Alternative methods such as ceramic hydroxyapatite CHT were also used to polish antibodies with good selectivity. Type II CHT resin with 40 m particle size Bio Rad Laboratories were used with a similar protocol as described for IEX chromatography. The binding buffer for CHT corresponds to 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 and antibody was eluted with a gradient of 20 160 mM sodium phosphate over 20 CV.

Binding specificity was tested by flow cytometry using purified antibodies. FACS histograms demonstrating the binding of muCD20 7 and muCD20 6 to CD20 expressing 300 19 cells and the absence of binding to the parental 300 19 cells are shown in . Either muCD20 7 or muCD20 6 antibody was incubated for 3 h with either CD20 expressing 300 19 cells or the non transfected 300 19 cells 1 10cells per sample in 100 L FACS buffer RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 normal goat serum . Then the cells were pelleted washed and incubated for 1 h with 100 L of FITC conjugated goat anti mouse IgG antibody such as is obtainable from for example Jackson Laboratory 6 g mL in FACS buffer . The cells were pelleted again washed with FACS buffer and resuspended in 200 L of PBS containing 1 formaldehyde. Samples were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with the HTS multiwell sampler or a FACS array flow cytometer and analyzed using CellQuest Pro all from BD Biosciences San Diego US .

The FACS histograms of CD20 expressing 300 19 cells incubated with muCD20 7 or muCD20 6 showed a fluorescence shift while parental 300 19 cells did not . Also no significant fluorescence shift was detected when either cell lines was incubated only with FITC conjugated goat anti mouse IgG antibody alone bottom .

A fluorescence shift was also observed when BJAB lymphoma cells were incubated with muCD20 7 or muCD20 6 . BJAB cells were incubated with varying concentrations of muCD20 7 or muCD20 6 antibody and processed as described above for flow cytometry analysis. Data analysis was performed using CellQuest Pro BD Biosciences San Diego US and for each sample the mean fluorescence intensity for FL1 MFI was exported and plotted against the antibody concentration in a semi log plot. A dose response curve was generated by non linear regression and the value for the apparent dissociation constant K of muCD20 7 or muCD20 6 for the binding to BJAB cells was calculated using GraphPad Prism v4 GraphPad software San Diego Calif. and corresponds to 0.3 nM or 0.4 nM respectively.

The anti CD20 antibody muCD20 2 muCD20 6 and muCD20 7 induced apoptosis of lymphoma cell lines. The degree of apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry analysis after staining with FITC conjugates of Annexin V Invitrogen and with TO PROS 3 Invitrogen . In healthy normal cells phosphatidylserine is on the inside of the membrane bilayer and the transition of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is one of the earliest detectable signals of apoptosis. Annexin V binds phosphatidylserine on the outside but not on the inside of the cell membrane bilayer of intact cells. The degree of Annexin V binding is therefore an indicator of the induction of apoptosis. TO PROS 3 is a monomeric cyanine nucleic acid stain that can only penetrate the plasma membrane when the membrane integrity is breached as occurs in the later stages of apoptosis. Three populations of cells are distinguishable in two color flow cytometry Non apoptotic cells Annexin V negative and TO PRO 3 negative early apoptotic cells Annexin V positive and TO PRO 3 negative and necrotic cells or late apoptotic cells Annexin V positive and TO PROS 3 positive .

Exponentially growing cells were plated at about 2 10cells mL in 24 well plates in RMPI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum FBS 2 mM L glutamine and gentamycin denoted below as complete RMPI 1640 medium . Cells were generally grown in complete RMPI 1640 medium unless stated otherwise. Cells were incubated with 10 nM of anti CD20 antibodies for 20 24 h at 37 C. in a humidified 5 COincubator. The cells were then pelleted washed twice with 500 l PBS resuspended in 100 L binding buffer 10 mM Hepes NaOH pH 7.4 140 mM NaCl 2.5 mM CaCl and stained with 5 L of Annexin V FITC for 15 min on ice. Then 400 tit of binding buffer and 1 M of TO PROS 3 was added to the mix and the cell associated fluorescence of FITC and TO PROS 3 was immediately measured by flow cytometry. Five thousand events were collected for each sample. The dot plots for fluorescence of TO PRO 3 FL4 H y axis and fluorescence of Annexin V FITC FL 1 H x axis were generated using BD CellQuest software.

The percentage of Annexin V positive cells includes both TO PRO 3 positive and negative cells were determined for each sample from these plots and are shown in . Several antibodies isolated from our antibody screen were tested for pro apoptotic activity in comparison to rituximab. Unexpectedly muCD20 2 muCD20 6 and muCD20 7 showed very strong pro apoptotic activity. Greater than 70 of Ramos cells exposed to either muCD20 6 muCD20 7 or muCD20 2 were Annexin V positive compared to only about 5 of untreated cells. Treatment with the anti CD20 antibody rituximab resulted in only 13 of Annexin V positive cells. Similarly treatment with antibody muCD20 5 resulted in 12 Annexin V positive cells.

Likewise greater than 60 of Raji cells treated with muCD20 7 or muCD20 2 were Annexin V positive cells compared to 5 of untreated cells. This unexpected activity is even stronger than that of B1 a previously isolated type II antibody which results in 42 Annexin V positive cells. Incubation with rituximab resulted in 14 Annexin V positive cells. The muCD20 5 antibody did not induce a greater percentage of Annexin V positive cells as compared to untreated cells.

The reorganization of CD20 into lipid rafts following antibody binding has been correlated with the ability of the antibody to effectively recruit complement factors and elicit CDC activity. As a measure of antibody induced CD20 re distribution to lipid rafts we employed a flow cytometry based method modified from Cragg et al. 2003 supra . The principle of this assay is based on the TritonX 100 insolubility of lipid raft compartments at low temperatures.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation washed and re suspended in RPMI 1640 with 1 BSA. 0.2 mL of cells at 2.5 10cells were used for each assay in duplicate. Anti CD20 antibodies were added at 10 g mL and samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 C. Samples were centrifuged washed twice and re suspended in 0.2 mL of FACS buffer 1 PBS 1 BSA 20 mM Na azide . Samples were chilled on ice and kept cold from this point on. To detect the fraction of antigen associated with lipid rafts in response to antibody treatment samples were incubated with 0.5 TritonX 100 for 15 min on ice. To detect the total amount of antibody bound samples were left on ice for 15 min undisturbed. Samples were washed twice in FACS buffer and stained with FITC coupled goat anti mouse Ab diluted to 1 200 for 1 hr on ice. Samples were centrifuged washed twice with FACS buffer and resuspended cells in 200 PBS 1 formaldehyde for fixation. Samples were acquired by flow cytometry to determine anti CD20 antibody binding as mean of FL 1. Mean fluorescence intensity MFI was plotted for each sample in the absence untreated or presence Triton treated of TritonX 100 incubation in .

We used rituximab an example of a type I antibody that has been previously shown to efficiently translocate CD20 into TritonX 100 insoluble lipid rafts as a control. As expected rituximab treated cells show the same level of fluorescence with and without TritonX 100 treatment. In contrast the MFI of cells stained with muCD20 2 is much lower with TritonX 100 treatment than without. This is consistent with the inability of muCD20 2 to re distribute CD20 into lipid rafts a characteristic feature of previously described type II CD20 antibodies. Strikingly the MFI of cells stained with muCD20 7 is similar with or without TritonX 100 treatment. In addition we also tested muCD20 5 and muCD20 6 antibodies for lipid raft activity. As seen for muCD20 7 the MFI of cells stained with muCD20 5 or muCD20 6 is similar with or without TritonX 100 treatment. This data shows that muCD20 5 muCD20 6 and muCD20 7 like rituximab can efficiently translocate CD20 into the lipid raft compartment of the lymphoma cell membrane. Taken together with the results from the Annexin V assays this demonstrates that muCD20 2 has the characteristics of a type II antibody. It can strongly induce apoptosis yet cannot re distribute CD20 into lipid rafts. In contrast muCD20 5 has the characteristics of a type I antibody. It can re distribute CD20 into lipid rafts yet does not have pro apoptotic activity.

This surprising result demonstrates that muCD20 6 and muCD20 7 have a unique and unexpected combination of functional properties They have both the lipid raft activity of type I antibodies and the strong pro apoptotic activity typically seen for type II antibodies.

Total cellular RNA was prepared from 5 10cells of the CD20 7 and CD20 6 hybridoma using an RNeasy kit QIAgen according to the manufacturer s protocol. cDNA was subsequently synthesized from total RNA using the SuperScript II cDNA synthesis kit Invitrogen .

The procedure for the first round degenerate PCR reaction on the cDNA derived from hybridoma cells was based on methods described in Wang et al. 2000 J Immunol Methods. January 13 233 1 2 167 77 and Co et al. 1992 J. Immunol. February 15 148 4 1149 54 . VH sequences were amplified by PCR using the following degenerate primers EcoMH1 CTTCCGGAATTCSARGTNMAGCTGSAGSAGTC SEQ ID NO 37 EcoMH2 CTTCCGGAATTCSARGTNMAGCTGSAGSAGTCWGG SEQ ID NO 48 and BamIgG1 GGAGGATCCATAGACAGATGGGGGTGTCGTTTTGGC SEQ ID NO 38 . VL sequences were amplified by PCR using the following degenerate primers SacIMK GGAGCTCGAYATTGTGMTSACMCARWCTMCA SEQ ID NO 39 and HindKL TATAGAGCTCAAGCTTGGATGGTGGGAAGATGGATACAGTTGGTGC SEQ ID NO 40 . Mixed bases are defined as follows N G A T C S G C Y C T M A C R A G W A T .

The PCR reaction mixtures were then run on a 1 low melt agarose gel the 300 to 400 by bands were excised purified using Zymo DNA mini columns and sent to Agencourt Biosciences for sequencing. The respective 5 and 3 PCR primers were used as sequencing primers to generate the variable region cDNAs from both directions. The amino acid sequences of VH and VL regions were deduced from the DNA sequencing results.

The preliminary cDNA sequences were used to search the NCBI IgBlast site for the murine germline sequences from which the antibody sequences are derived. PCR primers were then designed to anneal to the germline linked leader sequence of the murine antibody so that this new PCR reaction would yield a complete variable region cDNA sequence unaltered by the PCR primers. In addition a RACE PCR method was performed as described in Co et al. supra to sequence the full variable region sequence of the CD20 7 heavy chain. The PCR reactions band purifications and sequencing were performed as described above.

The cDNA sequence information for the variable region was combined with the germline constant region sequence to obtain full length antibody cDNA sequences. The molecular weights of the heavy chain and light chain were then calculated and compared with the molecular weights obtained by LC MS analyses of the murine CD20 7 and CD20 6 antibodies. The molecular weight measurements are consistent with the cDNA sequences for both the CD20 7 and CD20 6 light and heavy chains.

The variable sequence for the light chain variable region is cloned into EcoRI and BsiWI sites in the pchCD20 7LCZ plasmid. The heavy chain variable region is cloned into the HindIII and ApaI sites in the pchCD20 7HCN plasmid. Equivalent plasmids were constructed for chCD20 2 chCD20 9. These plasmids were used to express chimeric antibodies in HEK 293T cells using a standard calcium phosphate procedure BD Biosciences CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit Cat 631312 . Supernatant was purified using standard Protein A chromatography procedures as described above but the polishing chromatography steps were performed using either carboxymethyl CM fast flow ion exchange IEX resin GE Lifesciences and 10 mM potassium phosphate 10 mM sodium chloride binding buffer pH 7.5 or the alternative CHT methods described above.

The ability of chimeric antibodies to induce apoptosis on Ramos cells was measured by using Annexin V FITC and TO PRO 3 staining as described for the murine antibodies in the above example. 10 nM of each chimeric antibody was incubated with Ramos cells for 20 hrs followed by Annexin V staining and flow cytometry analysis and the results are presented in . chCD20 7 treatment resulted in 59 Annexin V positive cells as compared to only 11 in untreated samples. chCD20 2 treatment induced 43 Annexin V positive cells while rituximab treatment resulted in similar levels of Annexin V staining as untreated cells. Therefore CD20 7 retained its striking ability to induce strong apoptosis in Ramos cells after chimerization.

To assess complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC activities of chimeric anti CD20 antibodies cell based assays were performed according to a published method Gazzano Santoro 202 2 163 171 1997 . Antibodies were aliquoted in duplicate at 50 L well into a flat bottom 96 well tissue culture plate at various concentrations typically ranging from 5 g mL 3.3 10M to 2.3 ng mL 1.5 10M in RHBP RPMI 1640 20 mM HEPES 0.1 BSA 1 penicillin streptomycin medium. Target cells were added to the antibodies at 5 10cells in 100 l of RHBP medium per well. Lyophilized human complement Sigma Aldrich St. Louis US was reconstituted with 1 mL sterile purified water per vial and diluted 5 fold to a 20 stock with RHBP media immediately before use. 50 L well of complement solution was added to each well for a final concentration of 5 . Plate were incubated for 2 h at 37 C. in 5 COhumidified incubator to allow for complement mediated lysis. After this incubation time Alamar Blue reagent Invitrogen was added to each well at a final concentration of 10 to measure the viability of the remaining cells. The plate was incubated for 16 to 20 hours at 37 C. before measuring the fluorescence in relative fluorescence units RFU at EX540 EM590 nm. Controls included triplicate wells with media and complement but without cells media only 0 viability and wells with cells and complement but without antibody cells only 100 viability . The percentage of specific cell viability for each sample was determined by to the following formula Percent viability sample media only cells only media only .

Strikingly chCD20 7 antibody had similar CDC activity as rituximab on both Daudi and WSU DLCL 2 lymphoma cells as shown in . chCD20 7 reduced cell viability completely in both cell lines with an ECof 1.0 nM on Daudi cells and 2.2 nM on WSU DLCL 2 cells. Rituximab had CDC activity with an ECof 1.1 nM on Daudi cells and 2.8 nM on WSU DLCL 2 cells. As expected for a typical type II antibody chCD20 2 had no CDC activity against either Daudi or WSU DLCL 2 cells.

The CD20 7 antibody was humanized following resurfacing methods previously described such as for example in Roguska et al. 91 3 969 973 1994 and Roguska et al. Protein Eng. 9 10 895 904 1996 which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. Resurfacing generally involves identification of the variable region surface residues in both light and heavy chains and replacing them with human equivalents. Exemplary CDRs are defined as indicated in Table 1.

The CD20 7 light and heavy chain CDR s as defined for the resurfacing are given by way of example in Table 1. The Kabat definition for heavy chain CDR2 is also given for both the murine and human CD20 7. The underlined sequence marks the portion of the Kabat heavy chain CDR2 not considered a CDR for resurfacing.

Surface residue positions are defined as any position with its relative accessibility of 30 or greater Pedersen et al. 235 3 959 973 1994 . Surface residues are aligned with human germline surface sequences to identify the most homologous human surface sequence. For CD20 7 the human germline sequences used as the replacement surfaces were IGKV7 3 01 and IGHV3 15 04 for Vand V respectively. As can be seen from the lists in a total of 4 surface residues in the light chain and 9 in the heavy chain were replaced with the human counterparts. The heavy chain residue S28 is in close proximity to CDR H1 and since its substitution to the human T28 might result in reduced binding affinity a second resurfaced version was generated with murine S28 residue retained. show the alignment of the resurfaced sequences for the CD20 7 variable domain of both light chain and heavy chain with its murine counterparts.

The variable region sequences for huCD20 7 were codon optimized and synthesized by Blue Heron Biotechnology. The sequences are flanked by restriction enzyme sites for cloning in frame with the respective constant sequences in single chain mammalian expression plasmids. The light chain variable region is cloned into EcoRI and BsiWI sites in the phCD20 7LCZ plasmid. The heavy chain variable region is cloned into the HindIII and ApaI sites in the phCD20 7HCN plasmid. These plasmids can be used to express huCD20 7 in either transient or stable transfections in mammalian cells. Transient transfections to express huCD20 7 in HEK 293T cells were performed using a modified PEI procedure Durocher Y. et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 30 2 E9 2002 . Supernatant was purified by Protein A and polishing chromatography steps using standard procedures as described above for chimerized antibodies.

In order to compare the activity of huCD20 7 previously identified anti CD20 antibodies were cloned and expressed. The amino acid sequence for the HC and LC variable region of the 2F2 antibody ofatumumab was derived from WO 2004 035607 Teeling et al. 2004 supra using WO 2004 035607 s SEQ ID NO 2 for the HC variable region and WO 2004 035607 s SEQ ID NO 4 for the LC variable region. Likewise the amino acid sequence for the HC and LC variable region of the GA101 antibody the basis for afutuzumab was derived from WO 2005 0448959 Umana U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 641 2005 . WO 2005 0448959 s SEQ ID NO 40 corresponds to the described B HH6 construct was used for the HC variable region and WO 2005 0448959 s SEQ ID 76 corresponds to the described B KV1 construct was used for the LC variable region.

The variable region sequences for both antibodies were codon optimized and synthesized by Blue Heron Biotechnology. The sequences are flanked by restriction enzyme sites for cloning in frame with the respective constant sequences in single chain mammalian expression plasmids. Cloning expression and purification was carried out as described for huCD20 7 above. The resulting GA101 F antibody displays the typical fucosylation in the constant region and is thus not the defucosylated version used for afutuzumab.

Flow cytometry binding assays using BJAB cells and muCD20 7 chCD20 7 or huCD20 7 antibodies were carried out and analyzed as described in Example 2. depicts the dose response curves generated by non linear regression for each antibody. The value for the apparent dissociation constant K of each antibody was calculated using GraphPad Prism v4 GraphPad software San Diego Calif. . Chimerization or humanization did not affect the binding affinity of CD20 7 as the Kfor muCD20 7 chCD20 7 and huCD20 7 corresponds to 0.4 nM 0.5 nM and 0.5 nM respectively.

Crude cell lysates were prepared from WSU DLCL 2 cells e.g. a source of CD20 antigen to measure binding affinity by ELISA. WSU DLCL 2 cells were grown in roller bottles in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum 2 mM glutamine and 1 penicillin streptomycin all reagents from Invitrogen at 37 C. in a humidified 5 COincubator. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and cells pellets were washed twice with cold 1 PBS and subsequently lysed in lysis buffer 50 mM Tris pH 8 150 mM NaCl 5 mM EDTA 1 NP 40 0.25 sodium deoxycholate 25 mM octylglucoside . A volume of 1 mL lysis buffer was used for lysis of 1 10cells harvested. The cell lysates were homogenized by passing through a 22 gauge syringe needle ten times and the lysate was allowed to rotate for 45 minutes at 4 C. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 45 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 micron filters aliquoted flash frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C. Total protein concentration was measured by BCA assay e.g. Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit PIERCE US .

For ELISA experiments lysate preparations were diluted to 5 g ml total protein into coating buffer 15 mM NaCO 35 mM NaHCO pH 9.6 and coated onto Immulon 2HB plates at 100 L well for 18 to 24 hrs at 4 C. Plates were then washed three times with wash buffer TBST 0.1 Tween 20 TBS pH 7.4 at 200 L well. Plates were blocked with 200 L well of blocking buffer 1 casein TBS pH 7.4 for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed as before and then serial dilutions of antibodies were added to the plates at 100 L well. Plates were incubated for 3 hours at room temperature and then washed as before. A 1 5 000 dilution of goat anti human HRP in blocking buffer was added as a secondary antibody at 100 L well and allowed to incubate for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed as before and then 100 L well of TMB1 substrate BioFX was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 minutes before quenching with 100 of 450 nm stop reagent BioFX . The absorbance at 450 nm was read and plotted against the antibody concentration for each sample. A sigmoidal dose response curve was fitted for binding curves using GraphPad Prism v4 GraphPad software San Diego Calif. . The value for the apparent dissociation constant K was calculated from the binding curve for huCD20 7 shown in and corresponds to 0.8 nM.

The pro apoptotic activity of huCD20 7 was compared to the activity of muCD20 7. Ramos cells were incubated with 10 nM 1 nM or 0.1 nM concentration of muCD20 7 huCD20 7 or an huIgG isotype control antibody for 20 hrs followed by Annexin V FITC and TO PRO 3 staining and flow cytometry analysis. Percent Annexin V positive cells for each condition is shown in . huCD20 7 retained the strong pro apoptotic activity of muCD20 7. Approximately 60 of Ramos cells are Annexin V positive after treatment with 10 nM of either antibody as compared to 6 of isotype control treated cells.

The pro apoptotic activity of huCD20 7 against Ramos cells was compared to other CD20 antibodies. Rituximab and 2F2 are type I antibodies with previously described limited pro apoptotic activity while GA101 and B1 are type II antibodies with known strong pro apoptotic activity. B1 corresponds to the unlabeled form of Bexxar Coulter whereas GA101 F corresponds to the fucosylated version of afutuzumab or GA101 Roche and 2F2 corresponds to ofatumumab Genmab . Varying amounts of each antibody were incubated with Ramos cells for 20 hrs followed by Annexin V FITC and TO PRO 3 staining and flow cytometry analysis. The percentage of Annexin V positive cells was plotted against the antibody concentration in a semi log plot in and ECvalues were calculated from curves fitted using non linear regression analysis. huCD20 7 has the strongest pro apoptotic effect with a maximum percentage of Annexin V positive cells of 50 and an ECof 0.2 nM. It is even more potent that B1 which results in 34 Annexin V positive cells with an ECof 0.8 nM. GA101 F is less effective and results in 22 Annexin V positive cells with an ECof 1.7 nM. Rituximab has a limited effect on apoptosis of Ramos cells and results in only 12 Annexin V positive cells with an ECof 1.7 nM. Both 2F2 treated and the untreated samples contain 2 of Annexin V positive cells indicating that 2F2 does not induce apoptosis of Ramos cells. After subtraction of the untreated control value this corresponds to 48 Annexin V positive Ramos cells induced by huCD20 7 compared with 32 by B1 20 by GA101 F and 10 by rituximab.

The pro apoptotic activity of huCD20 7 was further compared to rituximab and B1 against an expanded panel of cell lines. Each cell line was incubated with 10 nM or 1.5 g mL of huCD20 7 or rituximab for 20 hrs followed by Annexin V FITC and TO PROS 3 staining and flow cytometry analysis. The percentage of Annexin V positive cells was plotted for each antibody and untreated samples and presented in . The huCD20 7 antibody was more active than rituximab and B1 in Ramos and Raji lymphoma cell lines. huCD20 7 induced 60 Annexin V positive cells in Ramos lymphoma cells compared with 29 for B1 9 for rituximab and 6 for untreated cells. After subtraction of the untreated control value this corresponds to 54 Annexin V positive Ramos cells induced by huCD20 7 compared with 23 by B1 and 3 by rituximab. huCD20 7 induced 58 Annexin V positive cells in Raji lymphoma cells compared with 42 for B1 14 for rituximab and 5 for untreated cells. After subtraction of the untreated control value this corresponds to 53 Annexin V positive Raji cells induced by huCD20 7 compared with 37 by B1 and 9 by rituximab. In addition huCD20 7 induced 39 Annexin V positive cells in WSU DLCL 2 DLBCL cells compared with 26 for rituximab and 5 for untreated cells. After subtraction of the untreated control value this corresponds to 34 Annexin V positive WSU DLCL 2 cells induced by huCD20 7 and 21 by rituximab. huCD20 7 induced 20 Annexin V positive cells in Jeko 1 MCL cells compared with 9 for rituximab and 8 for untreated cells. After subtraction of the untreated control value this corresponds to 12 Annexin V positive Jeko 1 cells induced by huCD20 7 and only 1 by rituximab. Finally huCD20 7 induced 58 Annexin V positive cells in Granta 519 MCL cells compared with 23 for rituximab and 18 for untreated cells. After subtraction of the untreated control value this corresponds to 40 Annexin V positive Granta 519 cells induced by huCD20 7 and only 5 by rituximab.

Lipid raft assays against Ramos cells were carried out for huCD20 7 as described above in comparison to other CD20 antibodies. Rituximab and 2F2 are type I antibodies with previously described lipid raft activity while GA101 F and B1 are type II antibodies that lack lipid raft and consequently CDC activity. As expected rituximab and 2F2 treated cells show the same level of fluorescence with and without TritonX 100 treatment . In contrast the mean fluorescence of cells stained with B1 or GA101 F is much lower with TritonX 100 treatment than without consistent with their inability to re distribute CD20 into lipid rafts. Strikingly the mean fluorescence of cells stained with huCD20 7 is similar with or without TritonX 100 treatment. Thus huCD20 7 like rituximab and 2F2 can efficiently translocate CD20 into the lipid raft compartment of the B cell membrane.

CDC activity of huCD20 7 in comparison to rituximab and GA101 F was measured as described for chimeric antibodies in example 6. Strikingly huCD20 7 antibody had similar CDC activity as rituximab on Daudi lymphoma cells as shown in . Rituximab or huCD20 7 treatment reduced Daudi cell viability completely with an ECof 0.23 and 0.25 g mL respectively. As expected GA101 F a typical type II antibody did not show any CDC activity against Daudi cells. A similar results was seen Ramos lymphoma cells as shown in . Rituximab or huCD20 7 treatment reduced Ramos cell viability completely with an ECof 0.09 and 0.014 g mL respectively. As expected GA101 F a typical type II antibody had minimal CDC activity against Ramos cells.

In addition huCD20 7 had more potent CDC activity than rituximab against WSU DLCL 2 and RL lymphoma cells. Rituximab reduced cell viability of WSU DLCL 2 cells to 34 at the highest concentration with an ECof 1.9 g mL. In contrast huCD20 7 reduced cell viability of WSU DLCL 2 cells to 11 at the highest concentration with an ECof 0.58 g mL . Rituximab moderately reduced cell viability of RL cells to 56 at the highest concentration with an ECof 4.3 g mL. In contrast huCD20 7 reduced cell viability of RL cells more completely to 11 at the highest concentration with a much lower ECof 0.67 g mL .

A lactate dehydrogenase LDH release assay was used to measure antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC of tumor cells lines using freshly isolated human natural killer NK cells as effector cells e.g. Shields J. Biol. Chem. 276 9 6591 6604 2001 . NK cells were first isolated from human blood from a normal donor Research Blood Components Inc. Brighton Mass. using a modified protocol for the NK Isolation Kit II Miltenyi Biotech 130 091 152 . Blood was diluted 2 fold with 1 PBS. 25 mL of diluted blood was carefully layered over 25 mL of Ficoll Paque in a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuged at 400 g for 45 min at RT. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC were collected from the interface transferred into a new conical 50 mL tube and washed once with 1 PBS. The PBMC were resuspended in 2 mL of NK isolation buffer 1 PBS 0.5 BSA 2 mM EDTA and then 500 L of Biotin Antibody Cocktail were added to the cell suspension. The Biotin Antibody Cocktail contains biotinylated antibodies that bind to the lymphocytes except for NK cells resulting in a negative selection of NK cells. The mixture was incubated at 4 C. for 10 min and then 1.5 mL of NK isolation buffer and 1 mL of Anti Biotin Micro Beads were added. The cell antibody mixture was incubated for another 15 min at 4 C. Next cells were washed once with 50 mL of NK isolation buffer and resuspended in 3 mL of NK isolation buffer. Then a MACS LS column was mounted on the autoMACS separator Miltenyi Biotech and pre washed with 3 mL of NK isolation Buffer. The cell suspension was automatically applied onto the column washed and the effluent fraction with unlabeled NK cells was collected into a new 50 mL conical tube. The resulting NK cells were plated into 30 mL of complete RPMI media RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 fetal bovine serum 1 penicillin streptomycin 1 mM HEPES 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate 1 100 MEM non essential Amino Acid Solution overnight. The subsequent assay and all dilutions were carried out in RHBP medium RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 0.1 BSA and 1 penicillin streptomycin .

Various concentrations of antibodies in RHBP medium were aliquoted in duplicate at 50 L well into a round bottom 96 well plate. The target cells were resuspended at 10cells mL in RHBP medium and added at 100 L well to each well containing antibody dilutions. The plate containing target cells and antibody dilutions was incubated for 30 min at 37 C. NK cells were then added to the wells containing the target cells at 50 L well. The typical ratio was about 1 target cell to 3 4 NK cells. At least the following controls were set up for each experiment NK cells alone target cells alone spontaneous LDH release target cells with NK cells antibody independent LDH release target cells with 10 TritonX 100 maximum LDH release . The mixtures were incubated at 37 C. for 4 h to allow for cell lysis. Plates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1200 rpm and 100 L of the supernatant was carefully transferred to a new flat bottom 96 well plate. LDH reaction mixture 100 L well from the Cytotoxicity Detection Kit Roche 1 644 793 was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 to 30 min. The optical density of samples was measured at 490 nm OD490 . The percent specific lysis of each sample was determined using the following formula percent specific lysis sample value spontaneous release maximum release spontaneous release 100.

Incubation with huCD20 7 lead to good ADCC activity against Ramos lymphoma and JVM 13 chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL cells in the presence of human NK effector cells. ADCC activity on Ramos lymphoma cells was compared for huCD20 7 rituximab GA101 F and 2F2 . Treatment with huCD20 7 resulted in approximately 80 Ramos cell lysis similar to activity that was observed with the other CD20 antibodies. ADCC activity by huCD20 7 had an ECof 1.1 ng mL rituximab had an ECof 3.5 ng mL 2F2 of 1.2 ng mL and GA101 F of 0.59 ng mL. ADCC activity of huCD20 7 on JVM 13 CLL cells was compared to rituximab and 2F2. huCD20 7 treatment caused approximately 40 JVM 13 cell lysis similar to rituximab or 2F2. ADCC activity by huCD20 7 had an ECof 0.23 ng mL rituximab had an ECof 0.29 ng mL and 2F2 of 0.17 ng mL.

The extracellular domain of CD20 contains two extracellular loops. The larger loop consists of approximately 44 amino acids between the third and fourth transmembrane domain. Most CD20 antibodies described thus require amino acid residues in the larger loop for effective binding. Mutagenesis analysis has identified at least alanine 170 A170 and proline 172 P172 as critical residues for antibody binding Polyak 99 3256 3262 2002 and Polyak 161 3242 3248 1998 . Changing A170 and P172 residues to serines the amino acid found at this positions in murine CD20 abolished binding of CD20 antibodies such as B1. Likewise introduction of the A170 and P172 residues into CD20 containing the murine large extracellular loop allowed binding of most CD20 antibodies including B1 and rituximab. In contrast an unusual set of antibodies including 2F2 has been described that have been reported to bind to the CD20 A170S P172S variant Teeling et al. 2006 supra . In addition changing residue asparagine 163 N163 or asparagine 166 N166 to aspartic acid reduced binding of 2F2 while this did not affect binding of other anti CD20 antibodies such as B1 or rituximab Teeling et al. 2006 Blood. 177 363 371 This novel epitope has been suggested to be linked to their biologic activity which entails potent CDC activity but limited direct pro apoptotic activity against tumor cells. To further characterize CD20 7 and CD20 6 we analyzed their binding to the CD20 variants.

The expression plasmid pSRa CD20 contains the entire human CD20 cDNA sequence codon optimized and synthesized by Blue Heron Biotechnologies flanked by XbaI and BamHI restriction sites for cloning into the pSRa vector. The CD20 A170S P172S variant CD20 AP was created by PCR mutagenesis using the 5 primer hCD20sacAP SS ATTAGAGCTCACACACCATATATTAACATATACAACTGTGAACCATCGAATTCCTCT GAGAAAAACT SEQ ID NO 41 together with a 3 end reverse primer SRaMfelR AATGCAATTGTTGTTGTTAACT SEQ ID NO 42 to amplify a SacI to Mfe1 fragment of the pSRa CD20 plasmid containing the A170S P172S mutation. This PCR product was cloned into the SacI and Mfe1 sites of the pSRa CD20 plasmid. Mutagenesis introduced an EcoRI site and the CD20 sequence change in the resulting clones that was verified by restriction enzyme digestion followed by DNA sequencing. The CD20 N163D N166D double CD20 NNDD and CD20 N163D CD20 N163D single mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis of the same SacI to Mfe1 fragment by modifying the specific codons in the 5 end primers. The CD20 N163D N166D mutant fragment was amplified with the hCD20sacNN DD 5 end primer ATTAGAGCTCACACACCATATATCGATATATACGATTGTGAACCA SEQ ID NO 43 and the CD20 N163D fragment was amplified with the hCD20sacN163D 5 end primer ATTAGAGCTCACACACCATATATTGATATCTACAACTGTGA SEQ ID NO 44 . The SacI to Mfe1 PCR fragments were cloned into the SacI and Mfe1 sites of pSRa CD20 and the constructs were screened for the introduced Cla1 or EcoRV sites respectively. Positive clones were further confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Stable cell lines were created by transfection of the CD20 variant expression plasmids into 300 19 cells using known electroporation procedures. Briefly 5 10300 19 cells were electroporated in cold RPMI 1640 media using a BioRad Gene Pulser set at 260V and 960 F. Subsequently cells were diluted and plated into 96 well plates in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10 FBS and 50 M mercaptoethanol. After 24 hours G418 e.g. such as is obtainable from Invitrogen was added at a final concentration of 2 mg mL to select for transfected cells. After 2 weeks single colonies were isolated and expanded.

Binding of various CD20 antibodies to CD20 AP expressing human CD20 wildtype and variants was analyzed by flow cytometry. As can be seen in and all antibodies including CD20 7 and CD20 6 bound to wild type CD20 expressing cells. Data obtained for the CD20AP variant is shown in . As expected rituximab and GA101 F did not bind the CD20AP variant while B1 showed minimal binding. In contrast 2F2 can bind the CD20AP variant as previously reported Teeling et al. 2006 supra . Surprisingly huCD20 7 binds the CD20AP variant see . Similarity muCD20 6 and muCD20 7 are also able to bind the CD20AP variant see . The N163D and N166D mutations have been shown to reduce binding of 2F2 while not affecting binding of other anti CD20 antibodies such as B1 or rituximab. As expected rituximab and GA101 F bound the CD20 N163D variant while 2F2 showed reduced binding . In contrast huCD20 7 muCD20 7 and muCD20 6 showed a loss of binding to CD20 N163D. Similarly rituximab and GA101 F bound the CD20 N163D N166D variant while 2F2 showed minimal binding . Again huCD20 7 muCD20 7 and muCD20 6 showed a loss of binding to the CD20 N163D N166D.

This unexpected result indicates that huCD20 7 is functionally related to type II Abs such as GA101 and B1 but clearly requires a different epitope than those antibodies. Unlike most other antibodies huCD20 7 is not dependent on the A170 and P172 residues of CD20. Therefore huCD20 7 is a novel CD20 antibody with a heretofore unrealized combination of physical and functional features.

The N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridyldithio pentanoate SPP linker was dissolved in ethanol. The huCD20 7 antibody was incubated at 8 mg mL with a 7 fold molar excess of SPP linker for approximately 100 minutes at room temperature in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 containing 50 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA and 5 ethanol. The reaction mixture was purified using a SEPHADEX G25F column equilibrated with the aforementioned potassium phosphate buffer. Antibody containing fractions were pooled and used for subsequent steps.

An exemplary maytansinoid DM1 was dissolved in dimethylacetamide DMA final concentration is 3 and a 1.7 fold molar excess relative to the linker was added drop wise to the SPP modified antibody. After overnight incubation at room temperature the conjugated antibody was purified by chromatography on SEPHADEX G25F equilibrated in phosphate buffered saline PBS pH 6.5. The huCD20 7 SPP DM1 conjugate was then dialyzed into buffer containing 10 mM histidine 250 mM glycine 1 sucrose pH 5.5. The number of DM1 molecules linked per antibody molecule was determined using the previously reported extinction coefficients for antibody and DM1 Liu et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 8618 8623 1996 . The percentage of free maytansinoid present after the conjugation reaction was determined by injecting 20 50 g conjugate onto a HiSep column equilibrated in 25 acetonitrile in 100 mM ammonium acetate buffer pH 7.0 and eluting in acetonitrile. The peak area of total free maytansinoid species eluted in the gradient and identified by comparison of elution time with known standards was measured using an absorbance detector set to a wavelength of 252 nm and compared with the peak area related to bound maytansinoid eluted in the conjugate peak in the column flow through fractions to calculate the percentage of total free maytansinoid species. Conjugates with 3.5 4 DM1 molecules per huCD20 7 antibody were obtained with 

The Succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC Pierce Biotechnology Inc linker was dissolved in DMA.

After stirring for 2 to 4 hours under argon at ambient temperature the reaction mixture was purified using a SEPHADEX G25 column equilibrated with the same potassium phosphate buffer. Antibody containing fractions were pooled and used for subsequent steps.

The SMCC modified antibody was reacted with a 10 mM solution of DM1 at a 1.7 molar excess relative to the maleimide linker. The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature under argon for 4 to about 16 hours. The conjugation reaction mixture was filtered through a SEPHADEX G25 gel filtration column equilibrated with 1 PBS at pH 6.5. The huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 conjugate was then dialyzed into buffer containing 10 mM histidine 250 mM glycine 1 sucrose pH 5.5. The number of DM1 molecules linked per antibody molecule and the percentage of total free maytansinoid species were determined as described above. Conjugates with 3.5 4 DM1 molecules per huCD20 7 antibody were obtained with 

The exemplary N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridyldithio butanoate SPDB linker was dissolved in ethanol. The huCD20 7 antibody was incubated at 8 mg mL with a 5 fold molar excess of SPDB linker for approximately 100 minutes at room temperature in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 containing 50 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA and 3 ethanol. The reaction mixture was purified using a SEPHADEX G25F column equilibrated with the aforementioned potassium phosphate buffer. Antibody containing fractions were pooled and used for subsequent steps.

The maytansinoid DM4 was dissolved in dimethylacetamide DMA final concentration is 3 and a 1.7 fold molar excess compared to the linker was added drop wise to the SPDB modified antibody. After overnight incubation at room temperature the conjugated antibody was purified by chromatography on SEPHADEX G25F equilibrated with 1 PBS at pH 6.5. The huCD20 7 SPDB DM4 conjugate was then dialyzed into buffer containing 10 mM histidine 250 mM glycine 1 sucrose pH 5.5. The number of DM4 molecules linked per antibody molecule was determined using the previously reported extinction coefficients for antibody and maytansinoid Widdison W C et al. J Med Chem 49 4392 4408 2006 . The percentage of total free maytansinoid species were determined as described above. Conjugates with 3.5 4 DM4 molecules per huCD20 7 antibody were obtained with 

The DM4 mal PEG4 NHS reagent was dissolved in DMA to make a 12 mM stock solution. The huCD20 7 antibody was modified with 15 equivalents DM4 mal PEG4 NHS at an antibody concentration of 4 mg mL in 50 mM potassium phosphate 50 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA pH 7.5 and 10 DMA by volume. After stirring for 2 to 4 hours under argon at ambient temperature the reaction mixture was purified using a SEPHADEX G25 column equilibrated with the same potassium phosphate buffer.

The huCD20 7 PEG4 mal DM4 conjugate was then dialyzed into buffer containing 10 mM histidine 250 mM glycine 1 sucrose pH 5.5. The number of DM4 molecules linked per antibody molecule and the percentage of total free maytansinoid species were determined as described above. Conjugates with 3.5 4 DM4 molecules per huCD20 7 antibody were obtained with 

The DM4 mal 3 sulfo NHS was generated in situ by reacting 3 sulfo mal NHS linker with 1.6 equivalents L DM4 SH in 60 DMA 40 200 mM succinate buffer pH 5 for 2 hr at ambient temperature. 8 equivalents of the reaction mixture 4 mM linker concentration was added per huCD20 7 antibody 5 mg ml in 50 mM potassium phosphate 50 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA pH 7.5 and 10 DMA by volume. After stirring for 2 to 4 hours under argon at ambient temperature the reaction mixture was purified using a SEPHADEX G25 column equilibrated with the same potassium phosphate buffer.

The huCD20 7 sulfo mal DM4 conjugate was then dialyzed into buffer containing 10 mM histidine 250 mM glycine 1 sucrose pH 5.5. The number of DM4 molecules linked per antibody molecule and the percentage of total free maytansinoid species were determined as described above. Conjugates with 3.5 4 DM4 molecules per huCD20 7 antibody were obtained with 

Binding affinity of huCD20 7 after conjugation to SMCC DM1 or SPP DM1 was assayed by ELISA as described in the above example. The value for the apparent dissociation constants K were calculated from the binding curves shown in and correspond to 0.7 nM for huCD20 7 0.9 nM for SMCC DM1 and 1.1 nM for SPP DM1 conjugates. This result demonstrates that for example SMCC DM1 or SPP DM1 conjugation does not notably alter the affinity of the antibody e.g. CD20 7 .

In addition binding affinity of huCD20 7 after conjugation to for example sulfo mal DM4 was assayed by ELISA as described in the above example. The value for the apparent dissociation constants K were calculated from the binding curves shown in and correspond to 0.8 nM for huCD20 7 1.3 nM for sulfo mal DM4 conjugates. This result demonstrates that sulfo mal DM4 conjugation does not notably alter the affinity of the antibody e.g. huCD20 7 .

Pro apoptotic activity of huCD20 7 after conjugation to SMCC DM1 or SPDB DM4 was assayed on Ramos cells by for example Annexin V assay as described above. Ramos cells were incubated with varying concentrations of huCD20 7 antibody or conjugates for 20 hrs followed by Annexin V FITC and TO PRO 3 staining and flow cytometry analysis. The percentage of Annexin V positive cells was plotted against the antibody concentration in a semi log plot in . Treatment with huCD20 7 results in a maximum of 51 Annexin V positive cells as compared to 3 for untreated cells. Rituximab treatment induced only 10 of Annexin V positive cells. Treatment with huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 conjugates resulted in an increase in Annexin V positive cells to 73 while huCD20 7 SPDB DM4 treatment resulted in a further increase to 82 . In contrast SMCC DM1 or SPDB DM4 conjugates of a non binding isotype control antibody resulted in 4 or 8 Annexin V positive cells respectively. The pro apoptotic activity of for example huCD20 7 against Ramos cells is enhanced by maytansinoid conjugation.

CDC activity of for example huCD20 7 after conjugation was assayed on lymphoma cells in the presence of human complement as described above. As seen in for Daudi lymphoma cells exemplary SPDB DM4 and PEG4 mal DM4 conjugates of huCD20 7 had similar CDC activity as the unconjugated antibody with an ECof approximately 0.4 g mL. On WSU DLCL 2 diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells huCD20 7 huCD20 7 SPDB DM4 and huCD20 7 PEG4 mal DM4 had similar CDC activity with an ECof approximately 0.5 g mL. As seen in for WSU DLCL 2 cells huCD20 7 huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 SPP DM1 and sulfo mal DM4 had similar CDC activity with an ECof approximately 0.5 g mL. On Ramos lymphoma cells huCD20 7 huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 SPP DM1 and sulfo mal DM4 had similar CDC activity with an ECof approximately 0.02 g mL. Therefore CDC activity of for example huCD20 7 is maintained after maytansinoid conjugation.

ADCC activity of for example huCD20 7 after conjugation to SMCC DM1 was evaluated on Ramos and Granta 519 cells in the presence of human NK effector cells by LDH release assay as described above. As can be seen in huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 conjugates have similar ADCC activity as the unconjugated huCD20 7 antibody on Ramos cells with 40 maximum cell lysis each and an ECof 1.8 ng mL and 1.4 ng mL respectively. Similar results were obtained using other cells e.g. Granta 519 MCL cells as target cells. huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 conjugates have comparable ADCC activity to the unconjugated huCD20 7 antibody on Granta 519 cells with approximately 25 maximum cell lysis each and an ECof 0.22 ng mL and 0.14 ng mL respectively. As seen for CDC the ADCC activity of huCD20 7 is maintained after maytansinoid conjugation.

The ability of exemplary huCD20 7 conjugates to inhibit cell growth was measured using in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Generally target cells were plated at 5 000 cells per well in 100 L in complete RPMI media RPMI 1640 10 fetal bovine serum 2 mM glutamine 1 penicillin streptomycin all reagents from Invitrogen . Antibodies and conjugates were diluted into complete RPMI media using 3 fold dilution series and 100 L were added per well. The final concentration typically ranged from 3 10M to 4.6 10M. Cells were incubated at 37 C. in a humidified 5 COincubator for 4 to 5 days. Viability of remaining cells was determined by colorimetric WST 8 assay Dojindo Molecular Technologies Inc. Rockville Md. US . WST 8 is reduced by dehydrogenases in living cells to an orange formazan product that is soluble in tissue culture medium. The amount of formazan produced is directly proportional to the number of living cells. WST 8 was added to 10 of the final volume and plates were incubated at 37 C. in a humidified 5 COincubator for an additional 2 4 hours. Plates were analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm A in a multiwell plate reader. Background Aabsorbance of wells with media and WST 8 only was subtracted from all values. The percent viability was calculated by dividing each treated sample value by the average value of wells with untreated cells. Percent viability 100 Atreated sample Abackground Auntreated sample Abackground . The percent viability value was plotted against antibody or conjugate concentration in a semi log plot for each treatment.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of huCD20 7 and huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 against Ramos cells was compared to the activity of rituximab and a non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate. As seen in huCD20 7 incubation resulted in a reduction of viability to 60 while rituximab reduced viability to 80 . Treatment with huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 completely reduced viability with an ECof 0.68 nM while the non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate had an ECof 20 nM resulting in an unexpectedly significant 29 fold specificity window for huCD20 7 SMCC DM1.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of huCD20 7 and huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 against Daudi cells was compared to the activity of rituximab and a non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate. As seen in huCD20 7 incubation resulted in a reduction of viability to 65 at the highest concentration while rituximab reduced viability more moderately to 80 . Treatment with huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 completely reduced viability at the highest concentration tested with an EC50 of 0.77 nM while the non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate had an ECof 12 nM resulting in an unexpectedly significant 16 fold specificity window for huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 against Daudi cells.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of huCD20 7 and huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 against Granta 519 MCL cells was compared to the activity of rituximab and a non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate. As seen in huCD20 7 incubation resulted in a reduction of viability to 45 at the highest concentration while rituximab reduced viability more moderately to 60 . Treatment with huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 completely reduced viability at the highest concentration tested with an ECof 0.03 nM while the non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate had an ECof 13 nM resulting in an unexpectedly significant 419 fold specificity window for huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 against Granta 519 cells.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of huCD20 7 and huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 against SC 1 FL cells was compared to the activity of rituximab and a non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate. As seen in huCD20 7 incubation resulted in a reduction of viability to 35 at the highest concentration while rituximab reduced viability more moderately to 75 . Treatment with huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 completely reduced viability at the highest concentration tested with an ECof 0.39 nM while the non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate had an ECof 31 nM resulting in an unexpectedly significant 79 fold specificity window for huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 against SC 1 cells.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of huCD20 7 and huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 against DOHH 2 FL cells was compared to the activity of rituximab and a non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate. As seen in huCD20 7 incubation resulted in a reduction of viability to 20 at the highest concentration while rituximab reduced viability to 25 . Treatment with huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 completely reduced viability at the highest concentration tested with an ECof 0.12 nM while the non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate had an ECof 35 nM resulting in an unexpectedly significant 292 fold specificity window for huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 against DOHH 2 cells.

To further verify the specificity of huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 cytotoxicity its activity was compared to a non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate against non CD20 expressing Molt 4 T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. An increased concentration of both conjugates was used in this experiment to capture the relatively poor non specific cytotoxicity. As seen in huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 and the non specific conjugate showed the same cytotoxicity with an ECof 33 nM.

huCD20 7 for example is surprisingly more active than rituximab against Ramos Daudi Grant 519 SC 1 and DOHH 2 cells. The reduction in target cell viability is greater after incubation with huCD20 7 than that seen for rituximab treatment. In addition for example SMCC DM1 conjugation of huCD20 7 adds potent cytotoxic activity to the antibody. Viability of tumor cells was reduced more completely in response to conjugate treatment as compared to antibody treatment alone. When comparing huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 potency against that of non targeted huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugates a significant specificity window is observed for each CD20 expressing cell line indicating that cytotoxicity is a result of huCD20 7 antibody binding to target cells. In addition for example huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 and the non specific conjugate showed the same poor cytotoxicity against antigen negative Molt 4 cells. Thus the cytotoxicity observed for huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 is dependent on CD20 expression.

The in vitro cytotoxicity for example of huCD20 7 and huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 against Ramos lymphoma cells was compared to the activity of rituximab a rituximab SMCC DM1 and a non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate. As seen in huCD20 7 incubation resulted in a reduction of viability to 55 at the highest concentration while rituximab failed to significantly reduce viability. Treatment with huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 completely reduced viability with an ECof 0.72 nM while the non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate had an ECof 22 nM. Treatment with rituximab SMCC DM1 resulted in cytotoxicity with an ECof 3.3 nM. Thus huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 conjugates have more potent cytotoxic activity in vitro than rituximab SMCC DM1.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of huCD20 7 and huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 against for example Daudi lymphoma cells was compared to the activity of rituximab a rituximab SMCC DM1 and a non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate. As seen in huCD20 7 incubation resulted in a reduction of viability to 50 at the highest concentration while rituximab reduced viability to 65 . Treatment with huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 abolished viability with an ECof 1.0 nM while the non specific huIgG SMCC DM1 conjugate had an ECof 15 nM. Treatment with rituximab SMCC DM1 resulted in cytotoxicity with an ECof 2.6 nM. Thus huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 conjugates have more potent cytotoxic activity than rituximab SMCC DM1.

Radiolabeled conjugates of huCD20 7 and rituximab were prepared using essentially the same methods described by Widdison et al. Widdison et al. J Med Chem 2006 49 4392 408 for unlabeled conjugates with the exception of using tritium labeled DM1 H DM1 . This method is also described in detail in Erickson et al. Erickson et al. Bioconjug Chem 2010 21 84 92 .

Briefly antibodies are first modified at their lysine residues with N succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC and purified by gel filtration before conjugation to DM1 with tritium stably incorporated at its C 20 methoxy group. The tritium labeled DM1 was prepared from Ansamitocin P 3. The C20 methoxy group of Ansamitocins P 3 was removed by incubation with the bacterial strain to give ansamitocins PDM 3 Asai et al U.S. Pat. No. 4 307 016 . The C 20 OH moiety of ansamitocins PDM 3 was then methylated using tritium labeled methyl iodide by a method described by Sawada Sawada et al. Bioconj Chem 1993 4 284 289 . The ratio of linked maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule D A and the specific radioactivities was as follows rituxumab SMCC H DM1 3.5 D A 1.9 Ci mmol and huCD20 7 SMCC H DM1 3.4 D A 1.8 Ci mmol .

The two conjugates and the corresponding unmodified antibodies were all found to have similar binding affinities to CD20 positive SU DHL 4 cells . The cytotoxic potency of the two conjugates towards CD20 positive SU DHL 4 cells and CD20 negative COLO205 cells were assessed using a cell based viability assay as described in Example 15. Both conjugates were found to be potent with ICvalues of approximately 0.1 nM and 0.24 nM for the huCD20 7 SMCC H DM1 and rituximab SMCC H DM1 conjugate respectively . As expected both conjugates had poor potency against the antigen negative COLO205 colon cancer cell line with ECvalues of 34 nM and 11 nM for the huCD20 7 SMCC H DM1 and rituximab SMCC H DM1 conjugate respectively. This shows that the cell killing by these two conjugates is CD20 dependent. As in seen Example 16 for Ramos and Daudi cells huCD20 7 SMCC H DM1 conjugates have more potent cytotoxic activity than rituximab SMCC DM 1 against SU DHL 4 cells.

To assess the amount and type of metabolite formed after exposure of target cells to radio labeled conjugates cultures of SU DHL 4 cells 17 10 in 21 mL of RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10 FBS were exposed to 40 nM of the H conjugate for 30 min at 37 C. 6 CO. Cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 media to remove any unbound conjugate and re suspended in fresh culture medium 8 10cells mL and incubated at 37 C. 6 COfor 22 h. Cells were collected and suspended in 0.3 mL Tris buffered saline pH 7.5. Acetone 4 3 v v was added and samples were mixed and frozen at 80 C. for 1 h to precipitate protein. Samples were thawed and centrifuged at 2 000 g for 15 min and supernatants and pellets were separated. The supernatants containing the protein free maytansinoid metabolites were evaporated to dryness using an evacuated centrifuge. The extracts were dissolved in 0.12 mL of 20 aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.025 trifluoroacetic acid and the maytansinoid metabolites were separated on a Maytansinoids were separated on an analytical C 18 column Vydac 0.46 25 cm Erickson et al. Cancer Res 2006 66 4426 33 . The effluent was collected in 1 mL fractions and the radioactivity associated with each fraction was determined by mixing each vial with 4 mL Ultima Gold liquid scintillation cocktail before counting for 5 min in a Tri Carb 2900T liquid scintillation counter.

The acetone pellet was re suspended in 0.3 mL water and dissolved by the addition of 1 mL Solvable reagent Perkin Elmer . Samples were then incubated overnight in a 50 C. water bath. Samples were removed from incubation and 0.1 mL of 0.1 M EDTA and 0.3 mL of 30 hydrogen peroxide were added to each sample followed by 15 min room temperature incubation. Samples were then incubated for 1 h at 50 C. 0.2 mL of 1 N HCl was added to each sample before addition of 15 ml Ultima Gold scintillation fluid. Samples were agitated vigorously and kept in the dark over night before counting by LSC.

Short exposure of SU DHL 4 cells to both huCD20 7 SMCC H DM1 and rituximab SMCC H DM1 resulted a similar high level of the conjugates bound per cell . The amount of each conjugate bound per cell was determined from the total radioactivity associated with the cells following the initial exposure to conjugate and wash steps. Maytansinoid metabolites were quantified 22 h following exposure by acetone extraction and HPLC separation with radio detection. The sole metabolite observed within the cells 22 h following exposure to both conjugates was found to be lysine SMCC H DM1. No other metabolites were observed. The lysine SMCC H DM1 metabolite was previously identified as the sole target cell metabolite of huC242 SMCC H DM1 Erickson et al. Cancer Res 2006 66 4426 33 . The level of the lysine SMCC H DM1 metabolite 22 h following exposure of the cells to the huCD20 7 SMCC H DM1 conjugate was found to be approximately 0.6 mol 10cells. In contrast the level of lysine SMCC H DM1 metabolite 22 h following exposure of the cells to the rituximab H DM1 conjugate was found to be approximately 0.3 pmol 10cells. Therefore a two fold greater level of the metabolite is formed following exposure of cells to huCD20 7 SMCC H DM1 than following exposure to rituximab SMCC H DM1 . This increased level of metabolite formed by the huCD20 7 conjugate may lead to the greater in vitro activity of the huCD20 7 conjugate. Therefore huCD20 7 for example is an antibody with unique physical and functional properties that allow it to be more efficacious as a non cleavable conjugate in vitro.

Cytotoxicity of huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 was compared to that of conjugates prepared with different linkers. As can be seen in SPDB DM4 and PEG4 mal DM4 conjugates of huCD20 7 for example have similar cytotoxic activity as SMCC DM1 conjugates against Granta 519 cells. Either conjugates results in complete reduction of cell viability with an ECof 0.06 nM. As seen in SPP DM1 and sulfo mal DM4 conjugates of huCD20 7 for example also have similar cytotoxic activity as SMCC DM1 conjugates against Granta 519 cells. All conjugates result in complete reduction of cell viability with an ECof 0.1 nM.

The exemplary huCD20 7 antibody was tested using an established xenograft model of SU DHL 4 diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells implanted subcutaneous into SCID mice. Mice were randomized by body weight into treatment groups and treated three times weekly on days 14 21 and 28 post cell inoculation with either 10 or 1 mg kg of huCD20 7 or rituximab. The median tumor volume of the different treatment groups is plotted in . Rituximab treatment resulted in a decrease in median tumor volume as compared to the PBS control at both doses with the 10 mg kg dose being more potent than the 1 mg kg dose. Treatment with huCD20 7 at 1 mg kg resulted in a more pronounced decrease in median tumor volume as compared to the PBS than rituximab at the same dose. Treatment with huCD20 7 at 10 mg kg resulted in more dramatic tumor growth reduction vis vis rituximab. At day 66 of the study huCD20 7 treatment resulted in 7 of 10 tumor free survivors TFS while rituximab treatment resulted in only 1 of 10 TFS. No TFS were observed in the PBS control and both 1 mg kg treatment groups.

huCD20 7 antibodies and conjugates thereof were tested for in vivo efficacy in a xenograft model using Daudi lymphoma cells implanted intravenously into SCID mice. Mice were randomized by body weight into treatment groups and treated once on day 7 post cell inoculation with either 10 mg kg of huCD20 7 10 mg kg of huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 or 5 mg kg of huCD20 7 SPP DM1. The number of surviving mice in the different treatment groups is plotted in . The median survival for the PBS treated group of mice was 27 days. huCD20 7 treatment resulted in an increase in median survival to 45 days. Both conjugates resulted in a further increase in median survival as compared to the antibody. huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 and huCD20 7 SPP DM1 resulted in a median survival of 64 days and 58 days respectively.

In a similar xenograft model using Daudi lymphoma cells implanted intravenously into SCID mice mice were treated on day 7 post cell inoculation with either 10 mg kg of huCD20 7 rituximab huCH20 7 SMCC DM1 or huCH20 7 BMPS DM1. The number of surviving mice in the different treatment groups is plotted in . The median survival for the PBS treated group of mice was 31 days huCH20 7 treatment resulted in an increase in median survival to 49 days. In contrast rituximab treatment resulted in an increase in median survival to only 40 days. Both huCD20 7 based conjugates resulted in a further increase in survival as compared to the antibody huCH20 7 SMCC DM1 and huCH20 7 BMPS DM1 resulted in 90 and 100 survival on day 5 respectively.

In Vivo Efficacy of huCD20 7 Antibody and SPP DM1 and SMCC DM1 Conjugates in a DOHH 2 Xenograft Model

Exemplary huCD20 7 antibodies and conjugates thereof were tested in a pre palpable xenograft model using DOHH 2 follicular lymphoma cells implanted subcutaneous into SCID mice. Mice were randomized by body weight into treatment groups and treated once on day 3 post cell inoculation with either 10 mg kg of huCD20 7 10 mg kg of huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 or 5 mg kg of huCD20 7 SPP DM1. The median tumor volume of the different treatment groups is plotted in . huCD20 7 antibody treatment resulted in a decrease in median tumor volume as compared to the PBS control. Enhanced efficacy was seen for huCD20 7 conjugates as compared to the unconjugated antibody. At the end of the study on day 90 huCD20 7 treatment resulted in 2 of 10 tumor free survivors TFS while huCD20 7 SMCC DM1 treatment resulted in 6 of 10 TFS and huCD20 7 SPP DM1 treatment resulted in 10 of 10 TFS. No TFS were observed in the PBS control group.

Conjugates of CD20 antibodies have been described previously. In one case non cleavable SMCC DM1 conjugates of an anti CD20 antibody showed the same efficacy as the unconjugated antibody while a cleavable SPP DM1 conjugate of the same antibody showed improved efficacy in a Granta 519 xenograft model in SCID mice Polson et al. supra . Similarly calicheamicin conjugates of rituximab made with an acid stable amide linker did not show improved in vivo efficacy in a Ramos xenograft model in nude mice. Only calicheamicin conjugates of rituximab made with an acid labile dimethyl hydrazide Ac But linker showed improved in vivo efficacy in this study DiJoseph et al. supra .

Surprisingly non cleavable conjugates of huCD20 7 such as for example SMCC DM1 or BMPS DM1 conjugates show dramatically improved in vivo efficacy in 2 different xenograft models as compared to the unconjugated antibody. In addition cleavable conjugates of huCD20 7 such as for example SPP DM1 conjugates show equally improved in vivo efficacy as compared to the unconjugated antibody. huCD20 7 for example is an antibody with unique physical and functional properties that allow it be more efficacious as a non cleavable conjugate in vivo.

While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific aspects thereof it is apparent to one of skill in the art that various changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
