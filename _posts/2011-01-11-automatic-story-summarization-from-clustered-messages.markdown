title: Automatic story summarization from clustered messages
abstract: A set of stories may be related in a set of messages (e.g., news articles, weblog posts, or messages exchanged in a social network). Presented herein are techniques for automatically generating a summary of respective stories that may be used as a headline or title. These techniques involve identifying the entities referenced in each message, clustering the messages based on similarly referenced entities to generate a cluster of messages associated with each story, and identifying facts of the story that appear in many of the messages, which may be used to generate a perspective-independent summary of the story. Additionally, metadata regarding each message may be detected (e.g., the entities involved in each story, a meta-story of the story, and the perspective of the author in relating the story), and may be used to fulfill requests to filter the set of stories and/or messages based on these criteria.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a set of stories related in one or more messages. As a first example breaking news may be covered by several news outlets each of which may generate a stream of articles summarizing the news stories. As a second example a set of events occurring within a community may be described in blog posts among the members of the community. As a third example a group of friends may post messages within a social network describing various stories arising within the group. In these and other scenarios the stories may be automatically aggregated into a story feed e.g. a news server may be configured to retrieve the messages generated by a set of message sources e.g. one or more news outlets relating a set of stories and to present the retrieved messages as an aggregated news feed.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In scenarios involving an automated retrieval of messages from various message sources that present one or more stories different message sources such as authors or news outlets may report the facts of a particular story in different ways. For example the facts of the story may be related haphazardly within messages describing the story e.g. a commentary on a particular story may allude to some facts throughout the narrative but may not relate the entire story in a cohesive manner. An update or commentary on a story may also link or refer to another message that describes a story and may add facts to the story but may not recapitulate the original facts of the story. Additionally the facts may be related in different ways based on the perspective of the author in reporting the story e.g. authors writing from different political backgrounds may use very different terminology and phrasing to cover the same news story. As yet another example different message sources may cover a news story in different languages such as different cultural languages e.g. English and Spanish different literacy levels different tone e.g. a formal report of a story and a colloquial eyewitness report or different target audiences e.g. a medical study reported in a scientific journal and a popular description of the same study .

In order to provide readers with a summary of a story it may be desirable to develop an automated technique for summarizing a particular story. An automated technique may be able to extract cohesive summaries of stories without bias and may scale to handle a large volume and rate of messages. However it may be difficult for an automated technique to extract all of the relevant facts of a story from a particular message which may omit some facts or may describe some facts in an ambiguous or unusual manner that is difficult to recognize in an automated manner. This difficulty may be overcome by summarizing each stories based on all of the messages that relate the story. For example while different authors may use different terminology or language to describe a particular story an automated evaluation may identify a set of terms or phrases that often arise within messages about the story and may generate a summary of the story using such frequently arising terms and phrases. It may therefore be desirable to devise an automated summarizing technique that includes a clustering of messages about a particular story and that evaluates all such messages together to identify the basic facts of the story and to generate a summary from such basic facts. Moreover it may be desirable to design such automated techniques in an extensible manner e.g. in a manner that allows an adjustment of the summarizing process for a particular set of messages and the introduction of new processing techniques.

Presented herein are techniques for automatically extracting the facts of a story in order to provide readers with a cohesive unbiased summary of the story. In accordance with these techniques an automated message processing technique may evaluate a set of messages and may cluster the messages based on the stories that are related in such messages. For a particular story all of the messages relating to the story may be evaluated together the entities facts and phrases that appear frequently in such messages may be extracted as a summary of the story. The summary may be utilized e.g. as a headline or title of the story may be presented with messages associated with the story to provide additional context and or may facilitate searches for messages associated with a particular story topic or political sociological religious and or philosophical perspective. Additionally the summaries generated from the facts of the stories may be language and perspective independent and the automated generation may scale well to summarize a large number of stories related in a large volume of messages e.g. millions of messages presented in a social network on a particular day .

Additionally the processing techniques presented herein may be devised as an architecture comprising message processing pipeline e.g. wherein each message is subjected to a series of processing components each configured to transform the message identify concepts within the message and or extract particular facts from the message that may be included in the summary of the story. Implementing the message processing techniques presented herein as a message processing pipeline may promote the adjustment of the evaluation in view of different message sources e.g. choosing a first message processing pipeline using a first series of components for a first message source such as a formal news source and a second message processing pipeline using a different series of components for a second message source such as a colloquial personal weblog and may facilitate the customization of message processing with custom processing components e.g. a particular language component to translate slang phrases that frequently arise within a particular community .

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a set of messages that may relate one or more stories. As a first example a set of news articles may relate information about various breaking news stories or may update previously reported stories with additional information. As a second example a weblog or set of weblogs may present weblog posts generated by authors about a wide variety of stories that relate to one or more topics comprising a theme of the weblog and or that relate personal stories of the author. As a third example within a social network a group of contacts may exchange public private and semi private messages about various topics such as stories occurring within a group of friends.

In these and other examples the messages may be aggregated into a message set. However a user viewing the message set may not wish to see all of the messages but may have difficulty identifying the stories or topics related to respective messages in an efficient manner e.g. without having to read a substantial portion of the message . The user may also wish to filter the message set to a subset of stories or topics of interest or to view stories having a particular perspective e.g. written from the viewpoint of a particular political sociological religious and or philosophical position or from an author whose messages often espouse such a position . In order to satisfy the viewing interests of the user various techniques may be applied to categorize the messages to relate messages to particular stories or topics and or to identify various metadata for each message that may be utilized to filter the message set in a desirable manner.

The different content and story perspectives of different messages may add color and variety to the message set in reporting the stories and a user may find some messages more satisfying than others. In particular the user may wish to view messages having a particular characteristic such as relating to a particular story or to particular topics or written with a particular story perspective e.g. political news stories written from a particular political philosophy . In order to fulfill a request of a user to view particular messages it may be desirable to utilize an automated technique to evaluate and categorize stories which may efficiently and cost effectively scale to handle the evaluation of a large volume of messages e.g. millions of messages exchanged daily within a social network . In the exemplary scenario of an automated classifier is configured to identify keyword keywords within respective messages that may indicate the topics stories and or story perspectives related to each message . For example within the first message keywords may be identified relating to the name of the disease treated the name of the newly developed therapeutic technique e.g. a chemical or commercial name of a new drug and or the names of the researchers involved. The automated classifier may also classify the first message e.g. as belonging within the field of science. When a user submits a request to view messages involving a particular keyword the automated classifier may retrieve the messages identified as including the keyword and may provide such messages to the user .

However the use of keywords to identify messages relating to particular stories topics such as individuals or story perspectives may present some limitations. As a first example variations in the content of the messages e.g. differences in cultural languages target audiences personal opinions and formal or colloquial tone of the message may result in variations in the keywords included in different messages relating to the same story and or topic. As a second example a first message may refer to a second message e.g. a news update of a previously reported story or a weblog post or social network message authored as a response to an earlier weblog post or social network message and may therefore relate to the same stories topics and or story perspectives related in the second message but the first message may not explicitly reiterate the details of the second message and therefore may not include the same keywords . As a third example even keywords for topics identified by proper nouns e.g. distinctive names of individuals or locations may vary due to the use of slang or nicknames or the presence of typographical errors. For at least these reasons fulfilling the request of the user to view messages associated with a particular story based on a comparison of keywords may be inadequate in identifying the content of the respective messages and in providing requested messages to the user . As a second exemplary limitation the user may simply wish to browse the messages but may have difficulty identifying the content of any particular message without having to read a substantial portion thereof. For example more formal messages e.g. news articles posted by a news source may include a human generated headline but the headline may be inadequate e.g. a headline reading New Tax Cuts Enacted may fail to indicate the locality extent and date of the tax cuts and or may have been authored from a story perspective that obstructs inferences as to the contents of the message . Additionally presenting the keywords with the message may be inadequate to convey to the user the contents of the message e.g. presenting the detected keywords tax cut economy with a message may not adequately convey to the user the particular tax cuts discussed or the relationship between the tax cut and the economy that is suggested by the message and may therefore have to read a substantial portion of the message to identify the content presented therein.

In view of these disadvantages it may be desirable to configure an automated classifier to evaluate the semantics of respective messages in order to identify the stories topics and story perspective related by each message . In particular it may be desirable to generate an automated classifier that is capable of identifying the facts of respective messages and automatically generating a summary of a story referenced thereby. Moreover it may be advantageous to generate a summary of a story based on several messages relating the story where such messages are generated by a set of message sources e.g. different authors or news organizations . By using several messages an automated technique may identify facts that are frequently related in many messages generated by authors having a wide range of perspectives writing in a wide variety of languages and writing for a wide range of target audiences and may therefore use the frequently reported facts to generate the summary of the story in a perspective language and target audience independent manner.

These summaries generated in the exemplary scenario of and in accordance with the techniques presented herein may be used in various ways. For example the summaries presented to users as a summary title or headline of the respective stories and may be displayed with various messages to present additional context e.g. to relate the facts of a story that are referenced or implied by the message . Moreover the summary generated from the facts extracted from many messages may be independent of the story perspectives of the messages including the political sociological religious and or philosophical perspectives of the message sources of the messages . These summaries may also be less dependent upon the keywords that may or may not be included in each message e.g. the first message may omit the name of the author of the novel and the second message may omit the name of the novel but both messages may be associated with the same story that involves all of these facts and may therefore be included in searches submitted by users involving such facts e.g. the first message may be presented in response to a search for messages and stories about the novel even though the name of the novel is not mentioned in the first message because the first message is identified as associated with the story including a fact referencing the novel . Additionally the automated generation of summaries may efficiently and cost effectively scale to handle the categorization of a large volume of messages such as millions of messages posted within a social network on a particular day. These and other advantages may be achieved through the automated generation of summaries of stories according to the techniques presented herein.

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of generating summaries of stories respectively associated with at least one message such as the exemplary method of . In another such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a message processing pipeline for generating summaries of stories respectively associated with at least one message such as the exemplary message processing pipeline of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a nontransitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of and the exemplary message processing pipeline of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein these techniques may be utilized. As a first example these techniques may be utilized to evaluate many types of messages including news articles provided by various news sources weblog posts generated by various weblog authors web forum messages posted in various web forums public semi private and or private messages posted in various social networks and email messages sent and or received by one or more users . As a second example these techniques may identify many types of stories to which such messages relate including breaking news stories descriptions of past present and or future events fictional stories personal anecdotes commentaries on various political sociological religious and or philosophical topics and reviews of various products services and media. As a third example these techniques may while evaluating the messages extract many types of entities therefrom including individuals locations objects devices machines events bodies of knowledge concepts and collections of data. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many scenarios wherein the techniques presented herein may be advantageously utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the architecture of the embodiments. Some embodiments may be configured simply as a process e.g. the exemplary method of wherein a fixed set of tasks may be applied to the messages to generate summaries of the stories related therein. However it may be appreciated that the wide variety of scenarios wherein the techniques may be utilized may encourage a more robust architecture of an embodiment of these techniques that may be adjusted to account for the wide variety of messages . Therefore in some scenarios it may be advantageous to devise the architecture of an embodiment as a message processing pipeline such as the message processing pipeline in the exemplary scenario of comprising a modular set of interoperating components each of which performs one or more tasks upon respective messages being processed by the embodiment. For example in order to apply the message processing pipeline to the messages of a particular message source the message processing pipeline may be adjusted e.g. by swapping out some components with other components that are specially customized to evaluate messages from this message source or from the messages sources of a particular type e.g. a first component or set of components configured to evaluate messages of a technical nature published in an academic journal and a second component or set of components configured to evaluate messages of a casual nature published in a social network . Additionally the architecture of a message processing pipeline may more readily permit the insertion of new modules to provide additional features such as an evaluation of new types of metadata about the messages . For example the message processing pipeline may include a message processing pipeline customizing component which may be configured to upon receiving a custom component to be inserted into the message processing pipeline insert the custom component into the message processing pipeline . The architectural flexibility provided by a message processing pipeline may advantageously promote the application of such an embodiment to a wider range of message sources and or the customization of the evaluation to perform additional types of processing. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many types of architectures for embodiments of the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of extracting entities from various messages e.g. the configuration of an entity extraction component . Various text processing lexical linguistic and or statistical techniques may be utilized to achieve this extraction of entities . For example keyword analysis may be utilized to identify keywords appearing in the message . Such keywords may be identified using linguistic techniques e.g. the capitalization of words may indicate a proper noun naming an entity . Additionally for respective messages of the message cluster an entity extraction component may identify respective sentences and may identify a set of tokens within each message e.g. from the phrase Joe Smith rode a recumbent bicycle across the Golden Gate Bridge the tokens Joe Smith recumbent bicycle and Golden Gate Bridge may be identified optionally including the interstitial tokens rode a across and the . For respective tokens a speech part may be identified e.g. a noun verb adjective adverb article preposition conjunction or interjection and various entities may be extracted from the identified tokens. Alternatively or additionally facts may be extracted from the tokens optionally including tokens that are not necessarily associated with entities e.g. the token jogging may not be associated with a particular entity but if many messages about a story mention that a particular individual such as a celebrity was spotted jogging in a particular location the token jogging may be included in a fact about the story . Alternatively or additionally metadata may be utilized to extract entities involved in a message such as one or more hashtags associated with a message by a message source or various metadata items about the message e.g. for a recurrent event a date on which the message was authored or published may indicate a particular instance of the event to which a story relates . Those of ordinary skill in the art may identify many ways of extracting entities and facts from messages in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the evaluation of messages authored in different languages. Such languages may be cultural e.g. English French and Spanish tonal e.g. a formal language of a news organization and a colloquial language used within a social network or based on different target audiences and or literacy levels e.g. a report of a scientific story for the general population as compared with a report of the same scientific story in an academic journal . An embodiment of these techniques may encounter messages authored in many such languages and may be configured to handle the evaluation of such messages in various ways. For example a message processing pipeline may include a language identifying component which may be configured to for respective messages identify a language of the message e.g. based on linguistic analysis or a comparison of the vocabulary of the message with frequently used words in respective languages . The message processing pipeline may then utilize the identified language of the message in various ways. As a first example the message processing pipeline may define a target language e.g. a particular language supported by the message processing pipeline and may simply discard all messages authored in languages other than the target language. As a second example the language identifying component may upon identifying a source language of a message that is different from a target language automatically translate the message from the source language to the target language before further processing the translated message . As a third example the message processing pipeline may include one or more multilingual components featuring two or more language subcomponents that are configured to apply a particular task to messages respectively authored in each of two or more languages e.g. a first language subcomponent configured to process messages in a first language and a second language subcomponent configured to process messages in a second language . The message processing pipeline may therefore process a message authored in a particular language by invoking a corresponding a language subcomponent for the language. Using any of these techniques or a combination thereof the message processing pipeline may therefore evaluate a set of messages authored in a wide range of languages and may associate messages written in different languages with the same story .

A fifth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to additional features that may be included in an evaluation of messages e.g. additional processing and or transformation of a message that may promote the extraction of entities and facts and or the identification of additional metadata about respective messages that may be utilized while fulfilling a request of a user to view particular types of messages . As previously discussed the modular nature of a message processing pipeline architecture may promote the flexibility of an embodiment to incorporate such additional features e.g. by permitting a new component to be inserted into the evaluation process to implement the new feature.

As a first variation of this fifth aspect an embodiment of these techniques may be applied to evaluate messages of a message source that often includes various forms of slang e.g. unusual words nicknames or acronyms that are familiar to a particular community but that may be unusual or difficult to understand outside of the community . Accordingly an embodiment of these techniques may include a slang translating component which may be configured to identify at least one slang phrase of respective messages according to a language of the message e.g. the particular language of a community and to translate the slang phrase into at least one token of the message e.g. expanding a nickname for a particular individual into a proper name that may be associated with an entity .

As a second variation of this fifth aspect various messages may include references to various entities but some such references may be ambiguous. For example the token Bill included in a first message may refer to a particular friend within a social group but in a second message comprising a movie review may refer to an actor starring in the movie and in a third message involving a political story may relate to a particularly significant piece of legislation. Therefore an embodiment of these techniques may include an entity resolution component which may be configured to for respective entities identified by the entity extraction component identify at least one ambiguous reference of a message identifying one of at least two possible entities and among the possible entities identify the entity identified by the ambiguous reference of the message . For example when a particularly ambiguous token is detected in a message the entity resolution component may be invoked which may evaluate the context of the message and identify the entity referenced by the ambiguous token.

As a third variation of this fifth aspect various messages evaluated by the techniques presented herein may explicitly or implicitly reference an associated message. For example a news story may be later referenced by a message updating the news story with additional information or commenting upon the substance of the news story and a weblog post or message within a social network may explicitly or implicitly address another post or message in a responsive manner. Accordingly a message processing pipeline embodiment of the techniques presented herein may include a reference importing component which may be configured to for respective messages identify at least one reference to an associated message and import the at least one associated message into the message for the extraction of entities . For example if a message posted on a web page includes a hyperlink to an associated message the content of the associated message may be retrieved and included in the evaluation of the message to extract entities therefrom. In this manner the entities explicitly referenced by a first message may be imputed to associated messages explicitly or implicitly referencing the first message .

As a fourth variation of this fifth aspect a message about a story may be authored by a message source in view of a particular story perspective. As a first example a message source may hold a particular political sociological religious and or philosophical perspective and may author a commentary about a particular event issue or individual from that perspective. As a second example a message may be targeted to a target audience having particular demographics such as a particular age race gender ethnicity geographic location income bracket educational background literacy level or shared interests and the targeting may affect the story perspective of the message while relating the story e.g. for a story about a research study a first message targeted to the general population as a news story may have a different perspective than a second message targeted to an academic community as a technical article . Accordingly an embodiment of these techniques may include a story perspective identifying component which may be configured to for respective messages identify a story perspective of the message with respect to the story . For example the story perspective identifying component may identify a particular vocabulary associated with each perspective e.g. a first set of political buzzwords or slang often appearing in fiscally progressive messages and a second set of political buzzwords or slang often appearing in fiscally conservative messages and may identify the story perspective of a particular message based on the vocabulary utilized therein. The identified story perspective may be useful e.g. to fulfill a request of a user to present messages relating a story from a particular story perspective e.g. a user holding a particular political perspective may present a request to filter the messages of a message set such as news stories of a news feed to those authored from a story perspective. Moreover a message processing pipeline may also comprise a message source perspective identifying component which may be configured to for respective message sources generating at least one message identify a message source perspective of the message source according to the story perspectives of the stories of the messages generated by the message source . For example if a particular message source often generates messages from a particular story perspective the message source perspective identifying component may identify the message source as having a message source perspective matching the frequently identified story perspectives e.g. a fiscally conservative message source and this identification may later be utilized to fulfill a request of a user e.g. a request to filter a news feed to stories generated by news sources having a fiscally conservative perspective .

As a fifth variation of this fifth aspect in addition to generating a summary of a story based on a set of messages it may also be advantageous to identify a meta summary of the story . For example a first story may relate the historical visit of U.S. President Richard Nixon to the nation of China and a second historical story may relate a historical visit by the Queen Elizabeth II to the United States. Both stories involve three entities a U.S. President and a Queen of England both heads of state a visit and the nations of China and the United States both nations of the world thus both stories may be summarized with the same meta summary of a head of state visiting a nation of the world. It may be advantageous to associate both stories with this meta summary e.g. in order to answer more abstract requests of a user e.g. a request to present stories about heads of state visiting other nations during a particular week. Accordingly a message processing pipeline may include a meta summary generating component which may be configured to for respective stories classify respective entities involved in the summary e.g. the entities extracted from the messages relating the story according to an entity type and generate a meta summary classifying the story according to the entity types of the entities involved in the summary .

A sixth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the uses of the summaries of stories that are automatically generated by the techniques presented herein. As a first variation the summaries may simply be presented with respective stories e.g. as an automatically generated title or headline of the story or as a synopsis of the story . As a second variation the summaries may be presented with messages associated with the story e.g. to supplement the message with facts of the story that may have been omitted from the message .

As an example of this sixth aspect an embodiment of these techniques may store the summaries of respective stories and may use the stored summaries to fulfill requests of users . For example a message processing pipeline may include a story store which may be configured to store for respective stories a summary and at least one message associated with the story . The message processing pipeline may also include a story presenting component which may be configured to upon receiving a request to present stories retrieve from the story store at least one summary of at least one story and present the at least one summary of the at least one story in response to the request . Additionally upon receiving a selection of a selected story the story presenting component may present at least one message associated with the selected story in response to the request . As an additional variation the story presenting component may for respective stories to be presented in response to a request retrieve at least one media object involving at least one entity involved in the story e.g. an image of an individual or location referenced in the story and may present the at least one media object with the summary of the story .

Additional variations of this sixth aspect may permit a selective filtering of the stories so presented based on various metadata aspects identified while processing the messages associated with the stories . As a first such variation upon receiving a request to present stories involving a selected entity e.g. a particular individual or location the story presenting component may retrieve from the story store the summaries of stories involving the selected entity and present the retrieved summaries in response to the request . As a second such variation the story store may store with respective messages a story perspective of the message with respect to the story e.g. a political bias of respective messages about a political event and upon receiving a request to present messages having a particular story perspective with respect to a story the story presenting component may retrieve from the story store at least one selected message having the story perspective with respect to the story and may present the at least one selected message in response to the request . In these and other ways the messages and stories may be filtered in various ways to fulfill various requests of a user for a particular subset of stories and messages . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many uses of summaries of stories and associated metadata that may be automatically generated according to the techniques presented herein.
