The present invention was developed at least in part with funds from NIH Grant No. 1R21 EB003869 01. The United States Government may have certain rights in the invention.

The present invention is directed to improved methods for characterizing materials such as trabecular bone.

A major component of the human musculoskeletal system is bone which supports our body weight facilitates motion and plays critical roles in mineral homeostasis and production of blood cells. Osteoporosis is a disorder of the skeleton in which bone strength is abnormally weak and susceptible to fractures from minor trauma. Regions of the human body for which the risk is greatest include the spine hips and legs. In the United States about 30 million people have osteoporosis and almost 19 million more have low bone density. Approximately 700 000 vertebral fractures 250 000 hip fractures and 200 000 distal radius fractures occur annually in the United States and billions of dollars are expended each year for the care of osteoporosis in the U.S. Therapeutic treatments of osteoporosis are under intense development.

Clinical assessment of osteoporosis presently relies mainly upon bone mineral density BMD measurements. Two common techniques clinically used to determine BMD are dual X ray absorptiometry DXA and ultrasound. DXA measures the absorption of X rays by the bone tissue mostly by calcite minerals. In DXA X ray irradiation at two different energies is employed to distinguish the X ray absorption of bone from that of soft tissue. The amount of absorption provides a measure of bone density. DXA is currently the gold standard in osteoporosis screening. Ultrasound measures speed and attenuation of sound waves in bone to predict BMD. However the error associated with this technique can be significantly larger than that associated with DXA.

A drawback of BMD measurements is that the measured BMD is a gross average quantity and gives no information about either the structural integrity or the mechanical properties of the bone. While there is some correlation of bone mineral density with mechanical strength the property determining fracture risk there is a significant variation around the average correlation. For example in there is illustrated a graph of a relationship between bone strength and BMD for a set of excised human trabecular bone specimens. Apparent modulus in MPa a measure of the bone strength is represented on the vertical axis and apparent density BMD is represented on the horizontal axis. Line illustrates a correlation between the two quantities. As can be seen in there is an extensive spread of bone strength at a given density. While a definite correlation between BMD and fracture occurrence exists it is also clear that densitometry alone does not entirely predict the risk of fracture. This is because the details of the trabecular bone structure e.g. the bone quality and its evolution over time also contribute significantly to the strength of the bone and thus to the risk of fracture.

It is generally believed that bone microstructure also referred to as bone quality may have a significant impact on bone strength. Several medical imaging techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance NMR magnetic resonance imaging MRI and microscopic computed tomography CT have been used to extract structural information about bone samples. CT is one example of a microscopic imaging technique. Through a series of X ray radiographs acquired at different orientations a three dimensional image of the bone matrix may be constructed. This technique may be used to create an image with voxel resolution as fine as a few m. A voxel is three dimensional measure of resolution analogous to the two dimensional pixel. Compared to DXA CT is more sensitive to detecting bone loss but at the expense of requiring a much higher X ray dosage and is not currently viable for clinical use.

NMR and high resolution MRI studies of bone in vitro and in vivo have been conducted in the research community. Bone is a highly 80 porous medium consisting of a calcified solid matrix with soft marrow fat microvasculature and water filling the pore space. The MRI image of bone is actually the signal of the marrow space because the solid bone tissue does not produce much MRI signal under standard clinical conditions. Three dimensional images of bone with resolutions of 56 m have been obtained from small samples. Results of such MRI imaging have included a wide range of topological properties that correlate with bone strength of the sample. In vivo imaging is presently at a resolution above 100 m and sophisticated subvoxel processing has been tested to further enhance the resolution. From this direct measurement of bone structure topological parameters can be derived which theoretically and empirically relate to bone strength. However high resolution MRI is currently limited to the wrist and has not been applied to hip or spine.

Another property from which MR methods derive structural sensitivity is the difference in magnetic susceptibility between the solid and intervening tissue fluids. When the static magnetic field required for the NMR measurement is applied this susceptibility contrast gives rise to spatial variations of the magnetic field within the pore space. For example the broadening 1 T of the resonance line due to the magnetic susceptibility contrast between the bone matrix and the intervening marrow can be measured. This broadening depends on the bone architecture which in turn may provide a correlation of bone strength. The contribution of the static field inhomogeneity 1 T to the total NMR linewidth 1 T has been measured in vitro and in vivo for a variety of bone samples and subjects and has been found to correlate with strength parameters such as Young s modulus of elasticity. However 1 T based measurements have not yet reached the point of routine clinical use.

A primary clinical need of bone characterization in humans is the diagnosis of such disorders as osteoporosis in which abnormally weak bone strength leads to high fracture susceptibility. The standard techniques of dual X ray absorptiometry DXA and ultrasound determine bone mineral density BMD and have been used clinically to assess the fracture risk. However density alone does not account for the full bone strength variation because the internal bone structure apart from the bone density contributes significantly to the mechanical strength of the bone. As a result methods that rely on bone density measurements do not entirely predict fracture risk and their clinical value is therefore limited. Although high resolution magnetic resonance imaging techniques may provide three dimensional imaging of the trabecular architecture which may be useful for osteoporosis diagnosis their clinical application may be difficult. Specifically it is difficult to improve the resolution of such imaging techniques far beyond their current levels about 100 m in clinical implementation primarily due to clinically allowed X ray radiation dosage and the MRI scan time. Therefore these methods also may have limited clinical use.

Accordingly there is a need for a method of fracture risk assessment that is reliable and compatible with clinical use. Aspects and embodiments of the invention are directed to a different approach to the characterization of bone architecture than the high resolution imaging approach. According to one embodiment there is provided a method for trabecular bone strength determination using nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and magnetic resonance imaging MRI techniques. Various embodiments of methods according to aspects of the invention differ from conventional MRI methods because methods according to embodiments of the invention measure water diffusion as a way to characterize bone structure and because they may not require high resolution imaging.

According to one embodiment an NMR technique that is well established in inorganic porous media may be used to obtain statistical properties of the trabecular structure. This technique referred to as decay from diffusion in an internal field or DDIF can obtain pore structure characteristics at a resolution of about 1 m. As discussed below DDIF data on bovine bone samples shows a clear correlation with bone strength. Furthermore the DDIF data demonstrates a strong correlation with the projected surface to volume ratio and exhibits two regimes at the high and low bone strength. These two regimes may be interpreted as two types of bone weakening behaviors one by the loss of bone density at the low strength and the other by the change of bone architecture at the high strength. Correlation between the DDIF results and structural properties of bone samples observed in microscopic images suggest that the DDIF data may be used to characterize bone structure. Therefore in some embodiments DDIF measurements may provide a reliable indication of bone strength and may thus be used to assess bones without the need for high resolution imaging.

According to an alternate embodiment there is provided a method of in vitro or in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance and or magnetic resonance imaging to determine bone properties by measuring the effects of molecular diffusion inside the bone specimen to derive parameters that are related to the structure of the trabecular bones. The method is a non invasive probe that provides some topological information on trabecular bone without requiring a full high resolution image of its structure. The topological information can also be correlated via trends exemplified herein with mechanical properties such as yield stress. This correlation may provide an assay of bone strength relevant to diagnosis of osteoporosis. In some examples methods of the invention may be applied to determine structural parameters and properties of bone for example surface to volume ratio orientationally weighted S V pore sizes Young s modulus and the yielding stress. In other examples there may be provided a procedure to extract and analyze the aforementioned topological information as an average surface to volume ratio. This information may be gleaned from a DDIF experiment as recited previously. Furthermore in other embodiments analogous procedures using pulsed field gradients rather than internal field gradients may be employed yielding similar or complementary information.

According to one embodiment a method of strength estimation for a trabecular bone sample may comprise measuring an effect of molecular diffusion inside the trabecular bone sample using a magnetic resonance technique to provide measured data deriving a parameter from the measured data that is related to a structure of the trabecular bone sample and estimating the strength of the trabecular bone sample from the parameter. In one example the method may further comprise estimating the strength of the trabecular bone sample based on the parameter and the bone volume fraction. In another example the method may further comprise calculating a bone mineral density of the trabecular bone sample and estimating the strength of the trabecular bone sample may include estimating the strength of the trabecular bone sample based on the parameter and the bone mineral density. In another example the parameter derived may be a surface to volume ratio of the trabecular bone sample.

Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a procedure for obtaining an indication of a bone structure including measuring diffusion within a sample of the bone repeating the diffusion measurements at multiple times obtaining statistical information based on the diffusion measurements and extracting at least one bone property from the statistical information so as to provide the indication of bone structure. In one example at least one bone property includes a surface to volume ratio of the bone. In another example measuring diffusion may include measuring magnetization decay as a result of diffusion in an internal magnetic field of the bone.

There are two types of bone in the human body cortical bone a dense compact bone existing in the middle of a long bone and trabecular or cancellous bone a more porous type of bone found generally near major joints and in the spine . Trabecular bone is comprised of a complex three dimensional network of rods and plates. Most of the load bearing capability of the skeleton is attributed to the trabecular bone region. The development or deterioration of trabecular bone structure is significantly affected by the mechanical forces it experiences.

The mechanical strength of a bone specimen and thus the risk of its fracturing depends on several factors. One very important factor in bone strength is the amount of bone material which is related to various parameters such as bone volume fraction BVF porosity or the most common clinical parameter bone mineral density BMD . illustrates a graph of a relationship between bone strength and BMD. Apparent modulus in MPa a measure of the bone strength is represented on the vertical axis and apparent density BMD is represented on the horizontal axis. Line illustrates a correlation between the two quantities. As can be seen in there is an extensive spread of bone strength at a given density. While a definite correlation between BMD and fracture occurrence exists it is also clear that densitometry alone does not entirely predict the risk of fracture. This is because the details of the trabecular bone structure e.g. the bone quality also contribute significantly to the bone strength and thus to the risk of fracture.

Trabecular bone includes combinations of rods and plates with thicknesses diameters on the scale of 100 m in an interconnected network. Bone structure changes are governed at the cellular level by osteocytes osteoclasts which control bone erosion and osteoblasts which control bone formation. If the overall bone remodeling performed by these two cell types is imbalanced as is postulated to occur in osteoporosis serious weakening can occur in the trabecular bone network. These changes have been extensively characterized within and between different human subjects as a function age using DXA CT or MRI as is described in the literature. Structural indices such as mean trabecular thickness mean trabecular separation and trabecular number can be calculated from microscopic images and a wide variety of indices beyond these have been proposed to highlight structure anisotropy or correlation with strength. Many studies show that the parameter with the largest correlation with weakening is the trabecular number also known as the trabecular plate density or surface density which represents the number of trabeculae per unit length in a given direction. Trabecular widths are also known to decrease with age but typically less dramatically than the trabecular number and not sufficiently to explain the weakening in most cases.

This discrepancy is one of the motivations of a widely accepted model of bone degradation described in a paper by A. M. Parfitt Bone 13 S41 1992 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. This model rationalizes the fact that the only explanation for the observed progression in bone structure is not a uniform thinning of trabecular plates but a removal of entire plates with a consequent loss in connectivity. This removal is postulated to begin through a period of overactive osteoclastic resorption bone removal on a given trabecular plate that consumes the entire thickness at a certain point opening a hole or perforation that connects previously isolated regions of marrow. These perforations grow until eventually all that remains of the original plate are rods that connect to other adjacent plates. The trabecular number parameter that tracks this process and that correlates well with strength is analogous to a projected surface to volume ratio PSVR along a given direction. As discussed further below two NMR techniques employed in some embodiments of the invention may probe this projected surface to volume quantity.

Another important feature of trabecular bone is its anisotropy. Since many bones are under anisotropic mechanical load their structure and development show anisotropy along the load direction. This anisotropy is often quantified with a fabric tensor describing both the amount of anisotropy and its orientation. The fabric tensor may be characterized through microscopic image measures such as mean intercept length MIL density autocorrelation lengths or digital topology based orientation analysis DTA O . Models have been developed that relate these tensor elements to mechanical elastic moduli such as described for example in a paper by S. Cowin in Mechanics of Materials 4 137 1985 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Furthermore evidence exists that bone degradation can take place anisotropically with transverse rod sections more likely to disappear than longitudinal ones in some cases or portions of the life cycle. According to some embodiments of the invention there are described NMR techniques that may be suited to measure this anisotropy as discussed below.

It is to be appreciated that this invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways and the invention is not limited to the examples presented unless specifically recited in the claims. In addition it is to be appreciated that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of the words including comprising having containing or involving and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.

Referring to there are illustrated sections of processed three dimensional CT images of example cylindrical bovine bone samples that were used for measurements. Each figure shows for a given sample two slices one perpendicular to the cylindrical axis the other perpendicular to a radius and a 3D reconstruction of a cubical section 2 2 2 mm from the sample center. For clarity in the following discussion the samples will be referred to as sample A illustrated in sample B illustrated in and sample C illustrated in . The approximate dimensions for each sample are 8 millimeters mm in height 6 mm in width and 1 mm in thickness. In the image shows that the bone sample has a rarefied structure of loosely connected bone struts. shows a higher concentration of highly connected struts and shows a set of quasi parallel large plates. Qualitatively this is a progression of low to high to low projected bone surface area along the load bearing direction. The samples shown cover a range of mechanical yield stresses in a full sample set that was used for DDIF measurements in accordance with embodiments of the invention from weak 2.4 MPa to intermediate 6 MPa to strong 34.5 MPa . Qualitative differences in density shape and anisotropy of the trabecular elements may be observed in the images shown in .

The inability to accurately predict fracture risk in osteoporosis patients presents a need for new technologies that can determine the microstructure of bones and correlate it to bone strength. Many different magnetic resonance techniques may be applied to the characterization of the structure of trabecular bone. As discussed above nuclear magnetic resonance NMR magnetic resonance imaging MRI and microscopic computed tomography CT techniques have all been used to obtain information about bone samples. These methods have seen significant development in the research community but have yet to become the default clinical standard for various reasons. Thus there is a need for a method that may efficiently e.g. without requiring long scan times or high X ray doses provide useful information about bone quality.

To address this need some aspects and embodiments of the present invention provided a method for trabecular bone strength determination using NMR and MRI techniques. In one embodiment diffusion based NMR and MRI methods may be used to characterize the structure of a bone sample as discussed further below. Combining this measurement with the bone volume fraction BVF or BMD characterization and an empirically established correlation with mechanical properties of the bone may provide an improved measure of bone strength using fully non invasive techniques. Embodiments of methods for bone strength characterization described herein differ from conventional MRI techniques in that water diffusion may be used to characterize bone structure and high resolution imaging may not required. As a result the method may be suitable for clinical use and has potential for application as a routine MRI protocol.

Embodiments of the invention may provide two major advantages compared to the high resolution imaging approaches. One is that the invention may not require high resolution imaging which is difficult to perform clinically. Further combining aspects of the DDIF method described herein with low resolution imaging is clinically feasible. The second advantage may be that embodiments of methods according to the invention can provide a map of bone strength or a qualitative indicator thereof. Thus it may provide bone strength evaluation over large area of bones and can be used to identify the weak portion within a bone.

According to one embodiment a DDIF decay due to diffusion in the internal field based magnetic resonance method may be used to quantify the microstructure of trabecular bone for in vivo bone evaluation. A DDIF based method can obtain pore sizes down to 1 m which is significantly better resolution than currently achievable by high resolution MRI. Such high resolution may be achieved by monitoring water diffusion to obtain statistical properties of the internal structure of the bone. As discussed below the DDIF data can be directly correlated with mechanical properties of the bone and may provide a better indicator of bone strength than do conventional BMD. According to another embodiment pulsed field gradient PFG measurements may be performed to measure the surface to volume ratio of trabecular bones a parameter that may also be directly correlated with bone strength as well as with the DDIF data as discussed below. In addition PFG measurements may be used to probe bone anisotropy another parameter that may correlate with bone strength. In general PFG NMR and DDIF provide similar information of bone structure since both measure diffusion properties and are sensitive to anisotropically restrictive boundaries. The alternative avenues of the internal field gradient and the applied field gradient each have different advantages and their combined results may be complementary.

According to one embodiment a nuclear magnetic resonance method may be used to obtain statistical properties of the trabecular structure rather than high resolution imaging of the structure. This technique is referred to as decay due to diffusion in the internal field or DDIF. In water saturated rock DDIF measurements have been shown to provide a pore size distribution. DDIF relies on the presence of a difference in magnetic susceptibility between the constituents of the materials of a sample. When the sample is subject to an external uniform magnetic field B the susceptibility contrast may induce magnetic field non uniformity called the internal field. This internal field may possess a fingerprint of the pore space such as the length scale of the pores because it is produced by the pore structure. The DDIF technique may monitor water diffusion through this non uniform internal field and may determine pore structure from the diffusion dynamics as discussed further below. DDIF techniques and applications have been reviewed in several publications including Concepts of magnetic resonance 18A 97 2003 and NMR Imaging in Chemical Engineering edited by Stapf and Han chapter 3.7 Wiley VCH 2005.

As discussed above trabecular bone is a highly porous material comprising a network of trabeculae bone rods and plates . The term pore as used herein in the context of trabecular bones refers to the spaces in between the trabeculae. For simplicity trabecular bone can be considered to be a solid matrix with water filling the pore space. It is to be appreciated that this is an approximation with the actual bone structure being more complex however the approximation is sufficient for the purposes of demonstration and explanation of embodiments of the invention. As such a structure comprising two different constituents trabecular bone has magnetic field inhomogeneity and thus the DDIF technique may be applied to trabecular bone. For the unique structure and the high porosity of trabecular bone porosity 80 the internal field gradients mostly exist near the trabecular surfaces.

In general the DDIF signal decay may depend on the specific features of the internal field distribution such as the spatial extent of the internal gradients. However the probing length scale of the measurement is unambiguously given by the diffusion length of the spins according to equation 1 below for any pore geometry. square root over 2 1 where l is the length scale Dis diffusion constant and is the diffusion time. For the case of trabecular bones the fast decay signals originate from the pore surface layer. Therefore the DDIF result is closely related to the surface to volume ratio of the samples as discussed further below.

According to one embodiment the DDIF technique may employ NMR pulse sequences in which the internal magnetic field of the sample material encodes structural information in the initial and final intervals of the sequence. One embodiment of a simulated echo pulse sequence is illustrated in and may be described by 

Qualitatively the example may start by letting spins precess in the internal field for a time period of t. The first 2 pulse may rotate longitudinal magnetization into the transverse plane to precess at a frequency proportional to the local internal field B. During the encoding period each spin acquires a phase that is proportional to its local magnetic field. As a result the internal field variation within a pore may be encoded in the phase of the spins. More specifically a precession phase difference may develop between spins at different positions the precession phase modulation being given by Bt 3 where is the phase modulation and is gyromagnetic ratio of a proton. The phase modulation may follow the spatial characteristics of the internal field. For bone measurements tmay be on the order of ten milliseconds. At the end of the encoding period the spin magnetization is rotated to along the applied field direction to stop the precession. In one example this rotation may be achieved using another 2 pulse that may tip the transverse magnetization back into the longitudinal direction. As a result the spatial pattern of phase differences may be encoded as a spatial pattern of amplitudes of longitudinal magnetization.

After the encoding period the spins may be allowed to diffuse for a time period of t. In one example of bone measurements tmay range from one millisecond to several seconds. At the end of the diffusion period the magnetization decay due to diffusion may be recorded by a third 2 pulse to provide the stimulated echo. If the diffusion distance during tmeets or exceeds the length scale of this modulation the amplitude of the modulation will deteriorate and thus induce signal decay. The resulting signal attenuation as a function of the diffusion time t and may include a range of decay times determined by the distribution of internal field gradients in the specimen. In the case of trabecular bone this distribution is in turn connected to the topology of the bone network.

In one embodiment given the distributed response captured within a DDIF dataset one method of data analysis is to use Laplace inversion. Laplace inversion refers to the decomposition of a signal into a sum of decaying exponential functions and various conventional numerical techniques may be used to obtain a Laplace inversion spectrum from the DDIF dataset. After the inverse Laplace transform has been applied to the data the resulting magnitudes Afor different decay times form a spectrum that is herein referred to as a DDIF spectrum.

During the diffusion time another source of decay is due to spin lattice relaxation a process by which the spins lose memory of their excitation and return to equilibrium. According to one embodiment a reference scan may be used to measure this dependence which can also be distributed in general due to one or more of distribution of pore sizes relaxivities bulk relaxation. Referring to there is illustrated one example of a reference scan that may be used to measure spin relaxation and provide reference data. The influence of this relaxation decay can then be separated from the DDIF data in the analysis stage.

A series of DDIF measurements were carried out on a range of bovine trabecular bone samples extracted from the tibiae. The data were acquired under the same conditions and with nominally equivalent pulse sequence parameters. These data were analyzed within the Laplace inversion formalism as described above. However it is to be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the use of Laplace inversion to analyze the data and other techniques may also be used. For example a similar analysis using an initial decay approach may produce qualitatively similar results. The DDIF data were compared for each bone sample to two other characterizations a mechanical yield stress measurement and CT imaging as discussed further below.

DDIF examples were performed on the set of water filled bone samples in a 2 T proton magnetic resonance frequency 85 MHz horizontal widebore Nalorac magnet Nalorac Cryogenics Walnut Creek Calif. equipped with a Bruker Biospec spectrometer Bruker Biospin Billerica Mass. . The orientation of the applied field was along the cylindrical axis of each sample which was approximately the load bearing axis of the parent tibiae from which each sample was extracted. DDIF and reference signals were collected for a range of logarithmically spaced diffusion times tfrom 1 ms to 10 s and a range of encoding times tfrom 5 to 30 ms. It is to be appreciated however that the invention is not limited to the use of these example times nor to the use of a logarithmically spaced series of diffusion times.

Referring to there are illustrated graphs of signal decay rates of the DDIF and reference scans applied to each of sample A sample B and sample C. illustrates the signal decay graph corresponding to sample A illustrates the signal decay graph corresponding to sample B and illustrates the signal decay graph corresponding to sample C. In each of normalized signal decay is represented on the vertical axis and time in seconds is represented on the horizontal axis. The solid data points correspond to the DDIF scan for each sample and the open data points correspond to the reference scans for each sample. The data are arranged in order of increasing bone strength from corresponding to sample A shown in to corresponding to sample C shown in . While the relaxation reference data is roughly equal for all samples the DDIF data shows enhanced decay for sample B which has intermediate strength and high surface area .

As can be seen in there is a correlation between signal decay rates and yield stress. Referring to there is illustrated the Laplace inversion spectrum for sample A. Similarly the Laplace inversion spectra from samples B and C and shown in respectively. An evolution of the weight in the fast diffusion mode portion of the spectrum 20 ms

This trend is quantitatively represented in as an integral of the Laplace inversion spectrum over the relevant range as a function of yield stress. In other words illustrates the integrated decay weight in the fast decay region 20 ms

According to another embodiment time dependent diffusion may be measured by pulse field gradient NMR measurements. In one embodiment another method that may be used to evaluate pore structure is to use pulsed field gradients PFG to directly measure the water diffusion coefficient. From the time dependent water diffusion coefficient the surface to volume ratio of the medium can be determined as discussed below. PFG NMR and PFG MRI applications are numerous in porous media research and biomedical imaging. However the direct application of PFG NMR to bone strength evaluation has been largely absent. In one embodiment PFG diffusometry examples may be performed as a function of both diffusion time and diffusion sensitizing gradient orientation. This information may allow unambiguous determination of bone surface to volume ratios as a function of orientation thus probing the bone sample s topology and anisotropy.

In one example a PFG NMR technique may employ a stimulated echo sequence with internal field compensation an example of which is illustrated in . A bipolar gradient pulse may be located between the first two 2 RF pulses and another bipolar gradient pulse with identical width and amplitude may occur after the third 2 RF pulse . Refocusing pulses are also included to reverse the phase accumulation from internal field gradients. The diffusion decay at small gradients g follows an exponential form given by the equation 

In some examples PFG measurements were conducted in the same magnet system with the same samples and sample holder as were the DDIF measurements described above. The z axis gradient was oriented along the applied field and the samples cylindrical axis. A stimulated echo sequence such as that illustrated in with internal field compensation was used to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient ADC along each gradient direction and for a series of different diffusion times . A conventional stimulated echo sequence without internal field compensation can also be used to measure ADC. For a given diffusion time a single ADC was determined by measuring the echo decay for fixed sequence timing and variable diffusion gradient strength g. For a set of samples ADCs were measured along both the y and z directions for a range of diffusion times from 200 ms to 3 s with 2.5 ms and 2 ms. The bone diffusion datasets D t were normalized to that of bulk water value.

The behavior of the time dependent diffusion coefficient in a restricted diffusion medium is well understood for example see P. N. Sen Concepts of magnetic resonance 23A 2004 . The leading order behavior of D t is given by the equation 

Referring to there are illustrated the results of the time dependent diffusion coefficient measurements along two different gradient directions for the three bone samples sample A results shown in sample B results shown in and sample C results shown in . In each figure A C normalized D t is plotted against diffusion time in seconds for a transverse gradient direction y and a longitudinal or axial gradient direction z . Each sample shows a different amount of restriction and or anisotropy. In the open data series represents diffusion in the transverse y direction and the closed data series represents diffusion in the z direction for sample A see . In the open data series represents diffusion in the transverse y direction and the closed data series represents diffusion in the z direction for sample B see . Similarly in the open data series represents diffusion in the transverse y direction and the closed data series represents diffusion in the z direction for sample C see . The weakest sample sample A shows nearly unrestricted diffusion along both directions consistent with its high porosity. The intermediate sample sample B shows restricted diffusion in both directions with a more pronounced transverse than longitudinal restriction. Finally the strongest sample sample C mainly shows restriction primarily transverse to the sample axis giving it the maximum anisotropy of the three. This difference in anisotropic diffusion can be expected from the appearance of the samples as seen in the CT images in .

As described above a projected surface to volume ratio can be extracted from each D t dataset for both the longitudinal and transverse directions. The surface to volume ratio dataset for the transverse y direction referred to as PSVR data set and the surface to volume ratio dataset for the z direction PSVR data set are plotted along with the DDIF data data set as a function of mechanical yield stress in . The error bars in the PSVR data in are estimated from the variance of the measured D for bulk water sample. As can be seen in the correlation between the DDIF data and the PSVRdata is excellent in both the low and high strength regimes regions R and R respectively . The PSVRdata shows a different trend that increases with strength in the R region and remains approximately constant in the R region.

As discussed above the anisotropy of trabecular bone may be quantified with a fabric tensor describing both the amount of anisotropy and its orientation. According to one embodiment a measure of bone anisotropy may also be calculated from the PFG data which is related to the fabric tensor of the bone sample. Thus the PFG measurements may provide a method for quantifying anisotropy without requiring high resolution imaging. In one example no less than six measurements of PSVR along different directions are made and the SVR tensor can be fully determined including three eigenvalues and three directional parameters. This type of measurement is common within diffusion tensor imaging DTI . Given the eigenvalues of a rank 2 tensor e.g. diffusion tensor or the fabric tensor the fractional anisotropy FA is defined by the following equation 

In one example the FA may be obtained for the SVR tensor by measurements along z and y directions with 2 assumptions 1 alignment of the lab frame and principal frame i.e. the measured values for PSVR are the eigenvalues of the SVR tensor and 2 cylindrical symmetry i.e. PSVR PSVR. These assumptions are reasonable for this sample set and are supported by corresponding analysis of CT images of the samples as discussed further below. It is to be appreciated that the SVR tensor is not equivalent to the standard diffusion tensor but instead reflects deviations of the water diffusion from the bulk value. The contrast amongst samples of different structure and strength may be maximized using this tensor.

Referring to there is illustrated a plot of the fractional anisotropy FA of the SVR tensor calculated using Equation 9 as a function of yield stress. Again two regimes of strength are evident a weak regime R with yield stress 7 MPa with an increasing anisotropy with yield stress. This is consistent with the images shown in in which the stronger sample sample C can be seen to be more anisotropic than the weaker samples A and B respectively .

The anisotropy of the bone samples may also be described by another structural index referred to as mean intercept length MIL which may be calculated from CT images of the bone samples. To calculate the mean intercept length a threshold technique may be used on the raw CT images to divide the images into bone and water regions. Next test lines may be drawn through the images of the sample along a given direction. For example referring to there is illustrated an image of a sample with lines drawn in the y direction and lines drawn in the x direction. Similarly in there is illustrated an image of the same sample with lines drawn in the z direction. The lengths of the free segments between regions of bone may then be counted along each line in a given direction and averaged over the whole sample. The result is referred to as the MIL for the given direction.

Referring to there is illustrated the MIL for the set of samples from which the above described DDIF and PFG measurements were taken displayed as inverse lengths for ease of comparison with other results. Yield stress in MPa is represented on the horizontal axis. Three sets of data points are plotted series measured in the z direction series measured in the y direction and series measured in the x direction. As can be seen with reference to the inverse MIL values series and for the two transverse directions x and y show a similar trend that increases in the weak bone regime and saturates to a constant in the strong regime consistent with the trend in PSVRy shown in . The longitudinal inverse MIL data series is lower than the transverse values for all samples and shows an increasing trend for the weak regime but a decreasing trend for the strong regime. The trend is similar to that measured with the NMR diffusion techniques see e.g. however with more scatter.

A vital characteristic of an indicator of fracture risk is its correlation with mechanical strength represented in this case by the yield stress. Results from the two NMR techniques described herein namely the DDIF measurements and PFG measurements as well as reference to results of image analysis of the bone samples reveal correlations with yield stress. Referring to Table 1 there are given the Pearson s correlation coefficients r obtained from linear fits showing the correlation of the measurements with yield stress and or each other.

Referring to there is shown one example fit between the DDIF data and PSVR which showed one of the highest correlations r 0.84 . This correlation which is also found for a simpler initial decay analysis of the DDIF data underlines the sensitivity of the DDIF scan to topological properties of the trabecular bone network. In fact the progression with time of trabecular bone structure within the perforation model qualitatively parallels that shown by the sample set studied here. Strong healthy bones comprised of parallel trabecular plates can deteriorate through bone resorption to network of interconnected rods struts and finally to poorly connected rod groupings. Furthermore it should be noted that given the anisotropy of trabecular bone structure and therefore the internal field distribution the orientation of the applied field in the DDIF scan may be important and its variation can provide more comprehensive structural details.

Since many of the compared indices show anisotropy the complete sample set was included in the correlation only for analogous measurements e.g. DDIF vs. PSRVor PVSRvs. MIL . For other cases the yield stress correlation fits were performed in the weak strength regime of the sample set from YS 2.4 MPa to 6.0 MPa where the indicators all change monotonically with strength. The cases where the full sample set was used are shown in boldface.

The lowest row of Table 1 shows the correlation coefficient of a multilinear regression of yield stress versus a linear combination of bone volume fraction BVF and each of the other indices. This approach employs the new indices in a supplementary role to the bone volume fraction information. Note that the best benefit may be afforded with the inclusion of the PSVRor MILdata.

The dependence on strength shown in for the two longitudinal NMR measurements performed on the bone sample set is noteworthy. It shows an initial increase with strength to an extremum that occurs at YS 7 MPa and decreases for higher yield strengths. The same qualitative trend was obtained for the MIL indices derived from the CT images . Thus the samples fall into two classes a weak regime corresponding to R on the figures in which the bone samples are more isotropic highly porous and have relatively low strength and a strong regime corresponding to R in the figures in which the samples are more anisotropic less porous and have greater strength. The fact that the BVF strength correlation was most improved with the inclusion of PSVRdata which shows different behavior in the two regimes supports this classification. These correlations indicate that the information regarding the bone structure and strength may be accessible in the DDIF measurement at an applied field 2 T close to clinical values 1.5 or 3 T and involves neither micro imaging nor high applied gradients. This underscores its potential for application in clinical scanners.

A quantitative comparison of the results of these techniques is also worthwhile. All three longitudinal techniques DDIF PSVR and MIL show a dynamic range over the whole sample set of a factor of 2. Those that are calibrated also display approximately the same absolute values 0.5

While it is generally agreed that bone quality issues are vital to improved fracture risk assessment the variety of scalar indices employed to characterize this quality is quite broad. The indices derived from micro imaging techniques have a well defined geometrical meaning but those derived from bulk averaged measurements such as 1 T subscriplinewidth measurements ultrasound etc. are more empirical. For the diffusion based NMR measurements DDIF and D t the quantitative diffusion length l square root over 2Dt lends a solid geometrical basis to the measurement.

In the D t case this translates to a quantitative measure of the surface to volume ratio along the gradient direction. As indicated by the close agreement between the two measurements the DDIF signal is controlled by this parameter. This is a valuable connection particularly since the inverse of the projected surface to volume ratio is closely related to the mean intercept length which may be a dominant contribution in the trabecular number index.

The correlations of the structural indices described herein with strength BVF and each other are informative. To first order good correlations r 0.6 were obtained from all indices measurement derived or image derived both with strength and with each other. This result strengthens the interpretation that the diffusion NMR measurements may be controlled by the projected surface to volume ratio similar to CT image indices. Analyzing the list of correlations more carefully provides more insight on the relative advantages of the techniques. The best correlations with strength in the weak regime of this sample set are found with the NMR measurements r 0.93 with slightly worse results from the image analysis techniques r 0.80 . Similarly the best cross correlations for the whole sample set are found between experimental NMR measurements r 0.88 followed by image processing technique cross correlations r 0.77 with the lowest correlations when experimental NMR results are compared to image processing r 0.74 . Both NMR and image processing techniques correlate equivalently with BVF on average r 0.88 . One possible explanation for these correlation results is the difference in effective resolution. The minimum probing length of the NMR measurements given by the smallest diffusion length probed is on the order of a few m whereas the resolution of the CT images is somewhat larger 34 m . This may give the NMR based measurements access to a more accurate and complete projected surface to volume ratio than that derived from the CT images. However it should be noted that another possibility is that the lower correlations from the CT image analysis arise from the limitations in the present computational algorithms.

The non monotonic behavior of the DDIF signal as a function of bone strength suggests that currently it alone may not provide an estimate of mechanical bone strength. However when combined with the standard DXA bone density measurement which is also individually insufficient for strength determination a placement along the trend shown in is possible. Given the aforementioned correlation of this trend with osteoporotic weakening this placement has great clinical potential. The DDIF technique provides more topological information on the bone specimen than the more common bulk averaged 1 T NMR parameter but without the lengthy scan time and image processing required for high resolution CT or MRI. In this sense it could play a vital role as a compromise between information content and time in the arena of bone characterization.

The above sections demonstrate the principle and experimental tests of DDIF and PFG techniques for bone structure evaluation. The pulse sequences described in and can be directly used for in vitro samples of bones. However for in vivo applications spatial localization methods must be employed in order to isolate signals of bones from the surrounding tissues. Therefore according to some aspects of the invention there are provided methods to combine the diffusion based techniques with in vivo MRI. There are described herein a few types of pulse sequences to combine DDIF and PFG with spatial localization using MRI techniques according to embodiments of the invention. It is to be appreciated that since the diffusion based techniques provide information about the pore structure the MRI resolution of the methods described here does not need to resolve individual trabeculae. For example a voxel size of 1 mm or larger is most likely sufficient.

There can be two general approaches for including localization in DDIF and PFG. The first includes DDIF or PFG sequence as a weighting segment at the beginning of an imaging sequence such as spin warp EPI RARE FLASH etc. A summary of these sequences can be found in a book by Callaghan 1993 Oxford Oxford University Press which is hereby incorporated by reference. This approach is a natural extension of DDIF PFG and is sometimes used in conventional diffusion weighted imaging. The second approach uses 3D localization sequences in which the total signal originates exclusively from a prescribed voxel within the bone. Many 3D localization sequences can be used such as STEAM PRESS and ISIS. For example STEAM can provide DDIF contrast and spatial localization simultaneously. Here only a few examples will be discussed in detail to illustrate the concepts of the two approaches. However it is to be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the specific examples described.

In one embodiment DDIF or PFG may be used as a preparatory portion of the imaging sequence shown in . Because DDIF may obtain structural information through diffusion the imaging portion of the sequence may be of low resolution thus reducing the scan time. In one embodiment the sequence may comprise two parts namely the DDIF or PFG segment and the imaging segment. The DDIF segment may be the same as the standard DDIF sequence using three nonselective 2 pulses and producing a stimulated echo at a time to after the last 2 pulse. The imaging segment may include a slice selective c pulse and the gradients for slice selection phase and frequency encodings in a standard spin warp combination. The C pulse may be at a time te te after the third 2 pulse and the final echo signal may be centered at a time te after the pulse. The echo may be acquired for a series of phase encoding gradient steps to form a two dimensional 2D data set. Fourier transform of this data set will provide a 2D image of the bone weighted by the DDIF segment. Then 2D images with different tmay be acquired. From this data DDIF spectra can be obtained for each pixel in a similar fashion as described earlier.

In another similar embodiment the DDIF or PFG segment may remain almost as in with one exception. Rather than performing the slice selection with a separate pulse the third 2 can be made slice selective followed by a similar spin warp methodology for image encoding of the stimulated echo as illustrated in . This method may remove the need for another refocusing pulse and spin echo along with its additional unwanted Tweighting. Such an approach incorporates the imaging gradients into the DDIF sequence without introducing diffusion weighting that might compete with the DDIF contrast. Note that overlapping echo pathways preferably may be eliminated through spoiling and or phase cycling.

In another embodiment the DDIF or PFG segment may remain as illustrated in . The stimulated echo may be imaged with a single shot imaging method called Echo Planar Imaging EPI which includes an alternating train of gradient pulses for both frequency and phase encoding as illustrated in . In one embodiment this EPI method may allow a set of gradient echoes to be acquired within a single scan that comprises the full 2D k space dataset. Fourier transform of this data set will provide a 2D image of the bone weighted by the DDIF segment. In successive scans 2D images with different tcan be acquired. DDIF spectra may be obtained for each pixel in a similar fashion as described earlier.

In another embodiment the DDIF or PFG segment may remain as in . The imaging segment may include a slice selective c pulse at a time te te after the third 2 pulse which may generate an echo centered at a time te after the c pulse. This echo can be further refocused by a train of c pulses that are 2 te apart producing a train of echoes. These echoes can be phase and frequency encoded to produce the 2D data set. This technique is called Fast Spin Echo Imaging as well as Turbo Spin Echo or Rapid Acquisition w Relaxation Enhancement RARE and can allow a two dimensional data to be acquired in much shorter time than the spin warp method while introducing some relaxation T contrast and or image blurring as is illustrated in . Fourier transform of this data set will provide a 2D image of the bone weighted by the DDIF segment. Then 2D images with different tmay be acquired. DDIF spectra will be obtained for each pixel in a similar fashion as described earlier.

In another embodiment the DDIF or PFG segment may remain as in . The imaging segment may include a 3D localization sequence to select one volume voxel instead of capturing a full image. Such 3D localization sequences include stimulated echo acquisition mode STEAM point resolved spectroscopy PRESS and image selected in vivo spectroscopy ISIS sequences. A summary of these sequences can be found in a text by Callaghan P. T. in 1993 Oxford Oxford University Press herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The signal from these sequences may be derived exclusively from a voxel within the bone at an arbitrary location determined by the appropriate use of RF pulses and gradients. The signal may also be pre weighted by the DDIF segment. In multiple scans signals with different tcan be acquired. DDIF spectra may be obtained for this voxel in a similar fashion as described earlier.

In another embodiment the 3D localization and the DDIF or PFG contrast can be achieved simultaneously. One example of the 3D localization sequences as illustrated in . This sequence may include three slice selective 2 pulses along three orthogonal directions which can be applied at time intervals required by the DDIF contrast. In multiple scans the diffusion time tcan be varied and a set of signals for the selected voxel can be obtained. DDIF spectra may be obtained for this voxel in a similar fashion as described earlier.

According to aspects and embodiments of the invention NMR probes of trabecular bone structure have been demonstrated on a set of bovine trabecular bone samples and compared with several established characterizations. The NMR methods both employ the measurement of magnetization decay due to diffusion in magnetic field gradients. In one embodiment DDIF these gradients are in the variation of the internal field due to the susceptibility variation between bone and water or soft tissue . In another embodiment D t or PFG the gradients are externally applied in a sequence that compensates for the diffusion weighting of the internal gradients. Both examples demonstrate a non monotonic dependence on the mechanical yield stress of the sample set a trend that is determined by the projected surface to volume ratio along the load bearing axis of the trabecular bones. This trend was also found by two methods of analysis of microimages of the same samples obtained by microscopic CT imaging. These correlations show that the diffusion NMR methods may provide a reliable indication of bone strength and may thus be used to assess bones without the need for high resolution imaging since they provide measures that are equivalent to some of those obtained through imaging. Thus the NMR methods may provide a useful intermediate between two measurement extremes the NMR linewidth T a simple bulk averaged index and a microscopic image which requires long scan time . This intermediate has potential to play an important clinical role in improving fracture prediction risk assessment and screening for osteoporotic patients.

Having thus described several aspects and embodiments of the invention modifications and or improvements may be apparent to those skilled in the art and are intended to be part of this disclosure. It is to be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the specific examples described herein and that the principles of the invention may be used in a wide variety of applications. The above description is therefore by way of example only and includes any modifications and improvements that may be apparent to one of skill in the art. The scope of the invention should be determined from proper construction of the appended claims and their equivalents.
