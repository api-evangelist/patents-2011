This work derives from research under Government Contract W15P7T 05 C P004. The U.S. Government has rights in this invention.

The invention relates generally to radar apparatus. More particularly the invention relates to efficient calibration of radar apparatus that may provide for but is not necessarily limited to accurate angle of arrival calibration of a phased array radar apparatus.

Radar apparatus are commonly used in commercial and military settings for purposes of identifying and tracking a particular radar target within a particular geometric radar field of interest. In order to provide for accurate identification and tracking of such a radar target radar apparatus typically require calibration. For example accurate angle of arrival measurement within a radar apparatus often requires calibration of a radar antenna within the radar apparatus.

Such calibration of a radar antenna is often accomplished by measurement of radar antenna performance in a radar antenna test range such as but not limited to an anechoic chamber or a near field test range and subsequent construction of a look up table that relates radar antenna output signal voltages to incoming radar signals angle of arrival. In addition to such initial radar antenna calibration recalibration of a radar antenna or radar apparatus is also typically desirable under circumstances of radar antenna or radar apparatus malfunction or repair.

Calibration of radar apparatus may be effected subsequent to installation of the radar apparatus. Such post installation calibration of radar apparatus is often essential for assuring accuracy of such installed radar apparatus.

While post installation calibration of radar apparatus is thus a common and operative procedure for radar apparatus calibration nonetheless in certain military settings such as hostile environment settings field calibration of radar apparatus may present some difficulties or may not otherwise be practical.

Thus desirable within radar apparatus are methods that provide for radar apparatus calibration in other than field environments so as to assure efficient operation of the radar apparatus in field environments. Calibration methods are also desired as well that avoid the need for labor and time intensive measurements in a radar antenna test range such as an anechoic chamber or a near field test range.

Embodiments of the invention include 1 a method for determining values of performance parameters for a plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays and 2 a method for calibrating a phased array radar apparatus that may use the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays values of whose performance parameters are determined in accordance with the embodiments. Embodiments also include a particular test apparatus and a particular test system that may be used within the context of the foregoing methods.

Within the context of the embodiments and the claimed invention a phased array radar apparatus is intended to include a phased array radar antenna that is constructed of and comprises detachable subarrays. Each detachable subarray comprises 1 a combining network component and 2 an array of radiating elements component i.e. where the radiating elements are typically dipoles to thus provide a dipole component . Thus within the embodiments and the claimed invention a phased array radar antenna is intended to include 1 a multibeam phased array radar antenna with fixed phase shifters as well as 2 a more typical phased array radar antenna with adjustable phase shifters.

In accordance with the foregoing discussion phased array radar antennas in accordance with the embodiments and the invention comprise subarrays that include a radiating element component such as an array of dipoles i.e. a dipole component in conjunction with a combining network component. For design economy cost economy or other reasons the foregoing two components may be integrated into a continuous and contiguous structure without benefit of detachable connectors. It is anticipated that such integration may present difficulties since determination of values of performance parameters of a combining network component may not necessarily be readily measured directly absent physical separation of the combining network component from the radiating element component i.e. the dipole component . Often values of performance parameters of the combining network component must desirably be independently measured to sufficiently satisfy calibration requirements since the combining network often comprises signal distribution components i.e. power dividers and or couplers amplifiers filters and other such complex components that for calibration purposes are not generally amenable to independent modeling and analysis. It is anticipated that the radiating element component e.g. the dipole component and an immediate scattering structure that surrounds the radiating element component on the other hand are structurally less complex and readily amenable to characterization using modern computational electromagnetic CEM analysis computer code.

Generally the particular methods in accordance with the embodiments provide for determination of values of performance parameters for a plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays each of which includes a radiating elements component e.g. the dipole component and a beamformer component by independent electromagnetic measurements of the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays in the test apparatus. The resulting electromagnetic measurements may then be compared with reference electromagnetic measurements of a reference phased array radar antenna subarray i.e. a reference subarray which includes the dipole component but does not include the beamformer component. As a result of calculations involving these independent 1 electromagnetic measurements of the operational phased array radar antenna subarrays which include the dipole component and the beamformer component and 2 reference electromagnetic measurements of the reference subarray that includes the dipole component but does not include the beamformer component values for beamformer parameters and in particular values for beamformer scattering parameters for individual operational phased array radar antenna subarrays within the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays may be determined.

The resulting experimentally determined values for beamformer parameters i.e. scattering parameters for each of the operational phased array radar antenna subarrays within the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays may then be introduced into and integrated with the computational electromagnetic analysis computer code geometric model of the phased array radar apparatus that comprises the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays to provide in situ phased array radar apparatus performance characteristics which may serve as a basis for calibration of the phased array radar apparatus.

A particular method for determining scattering parameters for a phased array radar antenna subarray in accordance with the embodiments includes measuring for a reference subarray that includes a dipole component but not a beamformer component values for a plurality of reference electromagnetic parameters. This particular method also includes measuring for an operational phased array radar antenna subarray that includes the dipole component and the beamformer component values for a plurality of operational electromagnetic parameters. This particular method also includes calculating from the values of the plurality of operational electromagnetic parameters and the values of the reference electromagnetic parameters values for beamformer scattering parameters for the operational phased array radar antenna subarray.

A particular method for calibrating a phased array radar apparatus in accordance with the embodiments includes measuring for a reference subarray that includes a dipole component but not a beamformer component reference subarray port parameter signals for the reference subarray. This particular method also includes measuring for each of a plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays that each includes the dipole component and the beamformer component a corresponding plurality of operational subarray port parameter signals for the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays. This particular method also includes calculating for the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays a corresponding plurality of calculated beamformer parameter values from the reference subarray port parameter signals and the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarray port parameter signals. This particular method also includes using the plurality of calculated beamformer parameter values for the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays in a computational electromagnetic analysis computer code to determine modeled radar apparatus performance characteristics for the phased array radar apparatus assembled from the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays.

A test apparatus in accordance with the embodiments includes an enclosure that includes an array of test ports that mate with a plurality of signal ports of a phased array radar antenna subarray. The test apparatus also includes a means for energizing one of the array of test ports with an external signal while measuring a response to the external signal at the remainder of the test ports.

A test system in accordance with the embodiments includes a test apparatus comprising 1 an enclosure that includes array of test ports that mate with a plurality of signal ports of a phased array radar antenna subarray and 2 means for energizing one of the array of test ports with an external signal while measuring a response to the external signal at the remainder of the test ports. The test system also includes a computer programmed to calculate beamformer scattering parameters from the external signal and the response to the external signal.

The embodiments which include in part 1 a method for determining values for performance parameters for a plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays as well as 2 a method for calibrating a column array radar apparatus that may use the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays are understood within the context of an illustrative non limiting embodiment a description of which is set forth below. The description set forth below is understood within the context of the drawings described above. Since the drawings are intended for illustrative purposes the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale.

Within the context of this illustrative non limiting embodiment described in greater detail below the embodiments and the invention derive from a particular observation with respect to performance and calibration of a phased array radar apparatus i.e. which will be described within the context of a specific illustrative non limiting column array radar apparatus that includes a plurality of operational phased array radar antenna subarrays which will be described within the context of specific illustrative non limiting operational phased array radar antenna panel columns each of which includes a dipole component and a beamformer component. The observation considers that radiation pattern variations in performance of the column array radar apparatus that results from assembly of the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna panel columns may under certain circumstances derive from variation of the complex circuitry of the plurality of beamformer components included within the individual operational phased array radar antenna panel columns and not the plurality of dipole components i.e. the radiating element components included within the individual operational phased array radar antenna panel columns or the immediate geometry of assembly of the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna panel columns assembled to provide the column array radar apparatus.

Thus the embodiments and the invention contemplate that a knowledge of the influence or interaction of the complex circuitry of the beamformer components of a plurality of operational phased array radar antenna panel columns within a column array radar apparatus is desirable to accurately model the overall performance of the column array radar apparatus and thus properly calibrate the column array radar apparatus.

To that end the embodiments contemplate in a first instance a method for determining values for performance parameters such as in particular beamformer scattering parameters for each of a plurality of operational phased array radar antenna panel columns within a column array radar apparatus prior to assembling the plurality of operational phased array radar antenna panel columns into the column array radar apparatus.

For reference purposes to show a series of schematic diagrams illustrating an exemplary non limiting column array radar apparatus within the context of which may be practiced the embodiments.

More particularly illustrates the antenna within the column array radar apparatus as including a plurality of operational phased array radar antenna panel columns .

As is shown in greater detail in the antenna is constructed of 24 radially extending operational phased array radar antenna panel columns spaced at fifteen degrees and mounted by support rings to a central antenna cylinder that may under certain circumstances house a transmit matrix assembly and receive matrix switch assembly of which there are two as illustrated in . Operational phased array radar antenna panel columns can be removed and stacked for transport and can be quickly reassembled when the column array radar apparatus is deployed.

As is shown in A and B each operational phased array radar antenna panel column includes an etched substrate containing six vertically polarized dipole elements each with a pre selector filter limiter and low noise amplifier. The six vertically polarized dipole elements are combined on an operational phased array radar antenna panel column to form two stacked elevation beams that are offset in elevation angle by 17 degrees. A single elevation beam is generated on transmit centered on the lower receive elevation beam. The elevation beams are independently tapered in amplitude and phase to reduce the below the horizon elevation angle sidelobes to suppress the effects of ground bounce multipath. Each operational phased array radar antenna panel column also contains a pair of solid state power amplifiers that generate 30 watts of peak RF power at up to a 10 duty cycle. Each power amplifier drives three vertically polarized dipole elements through an unequal split three way power divider. Operational phased array radar antenna panel column further comprises cable connectors for electrical interconnection to radar electronics housed in central antenna cylinder and longitudinal slots formed parallel and adjacent to their respective inner edges. In addition each operational phased array radar antenna panel includes a plurality of placement pins that engage an opening formed through support rings in axial alignment with the slots to further ensure accurate alignment of the operational phased array radar antenna panel columns relative to cylinder as is illustrated in .

Each of the elevation receive beam RF signals and the transmitter RF signal from each operational phased array radar antenna panel column is fed into a 24 to 8 electronic matrix that instantaneously selects an 8 column sector and reorders the columns appropriately for the azimuth beamformers. For each azimuth dwell period only 8 of the 24 columns are active. On reception the azimuth beamformers form an azimuth sum beam and an azimuth difference beam with independent amplitude tapering for optimal sidelobe suppression. The transmit beam is untapered in azimuth.

While in particular illustrates an ideal radar emitter source pattern for the column array radar apparatus whose schematic diagram is illustrated in in practice such an ideal radar emitter source pattern is not realized and for that reason some type of calibration with respect to non ideal radar emitter source patterns for the column array radar apparatus of is desirable.

To that end the embodiments contemplate and are predicated upon the observation that in certain types of panel array radar apparatus constructions a non ideal radar emitter source pattern may be most significantly influenced by complex electronics associated with a beamformer component that is included on an operational phased array radar antenna panel column along with a dipole component e.g. six dipole components as illustrated in . The embodiments provide for an efficient bench top means of measuring the characteristics in particular scattering parameters of the beamformer component without having to break the connections to the dipole component.

To that end shows a schematic diagram of an operational phased array radar antenna panel column that is located and assembled into such a bench top test apparatus. Within 1 T is intended as the bench top test apparatus i.e. test fixture and the operational phased array radar panel column or reference array under test 2 S is intended as an aggregate of test apparatus based test port probe dipoles and either the reference array dipoles or the dipoles including feedlines component of an operational phased array radar panel column and 3 B is the beamformer component. The schematic diagram of also illustrates 1 six test ports a i.e. signal measurement ports at one side of the test port probe dipole and column dipole component S 2 six ports d or connections located interposed between the test port probe dipole and column dipole component S and the beamformer component B and 3 two ports c located associated with an opposite side of the beamformer component B.

In a first instance the embodiments provide for calculation of a value for the beamformer component B scattering parameters with respect to the feedlines of the column dipole component of S at the location of the ports d. Particular equations that govern determination of the value of the foregoing scattering parameter are shown as equation 1 equation 2 and equation 3 as follows 1 2 3 Within the foregoing equations 

Band Tare row matrices of respective scattering parameters between one of the c ports and the respective d or a ports 

subscripts xy where x and y are independently a c and d are reflected signal at the x port s with respect to incident signal at the y port s .

The foregoing equations provide a basis for determination of the value of beamformer scattering parameters i.e. Band B by making appropriate measurements of reflected signals and incident signals at the appropriate a d and c port locations for each individual operational phased array radar antenna panel column in a plurality of operational phased array radar antenna panel columns that are assembled to fabricate a column array radar apparatus. Equation 3 is preferred over 2 because 3 avoids the inversion of T S. Under well matched conditions T S.

In general illustrates a test fixture F that is intended as the bench top test apparatus. The test fixture F is comprised of cabling and a physical enclosure including test ports on the outside of the bench top apparatus that are connected to test port probe dipoles on the inside of the test fixture. As is illustrated in the test port probe dipoles on the inside of the test apparatus F are intended to mate with individual dipoles within a dipole component D within a operational phased array radar antenna panel column under test. As is further illustrated within the operational phased array radar antenna panel column under test also includes the beamformer component B to which there is connected the two c ports as illustrated in .

The test fixture F walls are conductive to minimize radiative interference and the interior of the test fixture F walls are lined with absorber to suppress interior resonances that could exacerbate measurement errors.

More particularly within the embodiments as is illustrated in electromagnetic measurements are intended to include an appropriate electromagnetic activation at any one of the six dipole ports a i.e. at the outside of the test fixture F and one of the two beamformer ports c depending on which beam is being calibrated with measurements at the remaining six electromagnetically unactivated ports. Such measurements will also include angular components of activation i.e. phase .

Within the same test fixture probes and test fixture F apparatus is used to determine the values of reference electromagnetic parameters for a reference antenna panel column that includes a dipole component D but not a beamformer component B. The same type of electromagnetic measurements are obtained in as in with in general the difference of absence of a beamformer component B within the reference panel column. The absence of the beamformer component B also provides for measurement or excitation at one of the six ports d rather than at one of the two ports c.

Within the electromagnetic measurements from the configuration of for each of a plurality of operational phased array radar panel columns and the reference electromagnetic measurements from the configuration of which may be undertaken only once for a single reference array are used to calculate the values of the beamformer component B scattering parameters pertaining to a plurality of operational phased array radar antenna panel columns . Such calculations are undertaken within the context of equations 1 to 3 above where particular definitions are provided within the context of .

As is illustrated in the beamformer scattering parameters are introduced into an otherwise generic computational electromagnetic analysis computer code model of the column array radar apparatus assembled from the operational phased array radar antenna panel column so as to provide a column array radar apparatus modeled performance which serves as a basis for calibration of the column array radar apparatus. In this model the dipole elements of all but the operational phased array radar panel column under test are terminated in the feedline impedance typically 50 75 or 100 Ohms .

Within the foregoing description a particular generic computational electromagnetic analysis computer code program for a column array radar apparatus that allows for adjustment of modeled performance of an operational radar antenna panel column predicated upon introduction of beamformer scattering parameter values is the WIPL D Pro computational electromagnetic CEM analysis computer program that is commercially available from the WIPL D organization at sales wipl d.com. Other commercially available CEM computer programs are available that are expected as operative alternative computational electromagnetic programs. The embodiments also contemplate a computer assisted system that employs an otherwise generally conventional computer for data acquisition manipulation and calculation within the context of the foregoing analysis.

Thus the embodiments provide a method for determining values of performance parameters of an operational phased array radar antenna panel column absent disruption of any portion of the operational phased array radar antenna panel column. Similarly the embodiments also provide a method for calibrating a column array radar apparatus that uses a plurality of such operational phased array radar antenna panel columns that is not predicated upon field calibration or other time or labor intensive calibration of such a column array radar apparatus.

In order to illustrate value of the embodiments and the invention amplitude and phase measurements were obtained 1 directly for a modified panel column comprised of two channels and 2 indirectly using the electromagnetic modeling and operational phased array radar antenna panel column measurement methodology in accordance with the embodiments. The beamformer part of the modified column was constructed from an Anaren Inc. 90 degree hybrid power divider with a simple T junction connected to one output to purposely introduce impedance mismatch. The third port of the T was terminated in 50 Ohms and not the matching 100 Ohms . The dipole array part was composed of two dipole elements with connectors that mated with the beamformer. The dipole array served also as a perfect reference array because it could be disconnected from the beamformer. This array was labeled R. Another reference array was built for testing as well and this array was labeled R.

Comparisons were obtained under three conditions which included 1 a restricted set of equations for modeling a column array radar apparatus in accordance with the embodiments i.e. impedance matched conditions were assumed and in particular that Taa Saa 0 where equations 1 and 3 general set reduced to 4 0 5 i.e. this restricted set was attractive because it required far fewer measurements than the general set 2 the general set of equations for modeling a column array radar apparatus in accordance with the embodiments and 3 modification of an operational phased array radar antenna panel column to reference port array separation from probe dipoles within the test fixture i.e. separation distance increased from near proximity 6.17 mm to 44.45 mm 0.19 wavelengths at operating frequency 1 300 MHz . Results for determination of amplitudes in dB and phase changes in degrees are illustrated in the Table that follows.

Within the Table either Reference Array Ror Rwas used as indicated. The column labeled Control contains the Bmeasurements made directly with the beamformer. That labeled Invent contains those measurements made indirectly using one of the reference arrays and either the restricted equations 4 5 or the general equations 1 3 . All amplitudes are in dB all phases in degrees.

Results in general show an increased level of correlation between 1 the control direct measurements and 2 the inventive modeling plus indirect measurements under circumstances where an adequate and general set of equations is applied. In addition the experimental data indicates that modifications to experimental parameters such as probe to operational phased array radar antenna panel column spacing may under reasonable experimental variations not unduly influence the favorable correlation that the inventive methodology exhibits with direct measurements.

The foregoing embodiments and experimental measurements are illustrative of the invention rather than limiting of the invention. Revisions and modifications may be made to methods materials structures and dimensions of components within the context of the various embodiments of the invention while providing additional embodiments of the invention in accordance with the following claims.
