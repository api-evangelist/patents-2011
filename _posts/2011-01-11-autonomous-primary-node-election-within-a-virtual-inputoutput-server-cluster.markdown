title: Autonomous primary node election within a virtual input/output server cluster
abstract: In a data processing system having a plurality of virtual input/output servers (VIOSes) configured within a VIOS cluster, a method, data processing system and computer program product provide for autonomous election of a primary node within a virtual input/output server (VIOS) cluster. A first VIOS performs the functions of: detecting that a primary node is required for the VIOS cluster; and autonomously initiating an election process to elect a next primary node from among the VIOSes within the VIOS cluster. When the first VIOS meets the pre-established requirements for becoming a primary node, the first VIOS obtains a lock on a primary node ID field within a VIOS database (DB) and then initiates a primary node commit process to assign the first VIOS as the primary node. The first VIOS issues a notification to the VIOS cluster to notify the other VIOSes that a primary node has been elected.

The present invention relates in general to distributed data processing systems and in particular to distributed data processing systems with cluster aware virtual input output servers VIOSes . Still more particularly the present invention relates to a method data processing system and computer program product that enable election of primary nodes within a VIOS cluster.

Virtualized data processing system configuration which provides the virtualization of processor memory and Operating System OS resources are becoming more and more common in the computer and particularly the computer server industry. To a lesser extent storage virtualization is also known and provided in limited environments. However within the virtualization computing environment storage virtualization and management is implemented as a separate virtualization model from server virtualization and management. One important component within this storage virtualization model is the virtual input output server VIOS which supports I O operations for one or more clients within the distributed computer system. In a large scale distributed computer system there can be a very large number of VIOSes individually providing access to different clients. With this configurations of separate VIOSes supporting separate clients different client logical partitions LPARs associated with different virtualized server systems may access the same storage access network SAN storage. However the client LPARs on one server do not have any knowledge of whether the SAN disk that the client LPAR is trying to access is being used by some other client LPAR belonging to the same server or another server. The conventional implementation of distributed server systems providing storage virtualization within shared SAN storage can cause data integrity issues and may potentially cause data corruption and client partition crashes.

Disclosed are a method data processing system and a computer program product that provide for autonomous election of a primary node within a virtual input output server VIOS cluster. The method is performed in a data processing system having one or more computing electronic complexes CECs that comprise a plurality of VIOSes configured within a VIOS cluster which has an associated VIOS database DB and in which each VIOS provides I O resources to one or more logical partitions LPARs executing within the one or more CECs. A first VIOS of the VIOS cluster performs a method comprising detecting that a primary node is required for the VIOS cluster and autonomously initiating an election process to elect a next primary node from among one or more VIOSes within the VIOS cluster.

In one embodiment the method further comprises determining whether the first node meets one or more pre established requirements to become a primary node by checking one or more configuration parameters of the first node against the one or more pre established requirements for a node to become the primary node and in response to the first node not meeting the pre established requirements activating a primary node discovery process which discovers and notifies a next node from within an elector list of a need for electing a primary node. The current node becomes the elector node if there is a next node that meets the pre established requirements to be a candidate for election. Also the method comprises in response to the first node meeting the pre established requirements determining whether a primary node identifier ID field within the VIOS DB is locked by another node in response to the primary node ID field being locked setting a primary node election timer to track an elapsed time from when the first node made the attempt to become the primary node and in response to the primary node ID field being unlocked locking the Primary Node ID field within the VIOS DB and initiating a primary node commit process to assign the first node as the primary node. In one implementation the timer expires after a pre set amount of time and the expiration of the timer prior to another node being elected as the primary node triggers the first node to re initiates an attempt to become the primary node.

In one embodiment the initiating the primary node commit process comprises sending a commit signal to the VIOS DB to update the primary node ID field with the unique ID of the first node unlocking the Primary Node ID field following the update of primary node ID field with the unique ID of the first node and issuing a notification message to all other nodes in the cluster to inform the other nodes that a new primary node has been elected.

The above summary contains simplifications generalizations and omissions of detail and is not intended as a comprehensive description of the claimed subject matter but rather is intended to provide a brief overview of some of the functionality associated therewith. Other systems methods functionality features and advantages of the claimed subject matter will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed written description.

Material presented in any one section may be applicable to a next section and vice versa. The following sequence of headings and subheadings are presented within the specification 

With specific reference now to there is depicted a block diagram of an example cluster aware CA distributed data processing system DPS architecture within which the functional aspects of the described embodiments may advantageously be implemented. For simplicity cluster aware distributed DPS architecture shall be referred to herein simply as DPS . DPS comprises a plurality of computing nodes each referred to herein as a computing electronic complex CEC of which CECs A and B are illustrated. The number of CECs within DPS may vary ranging from a single CEC in a smaller system extending up to hundreds or thousands of CECs in larger scaled systems. For simplicity the embodiments shall be described from the perspective of a single CEC CEC A or two CECs CECs A B . Each CEC A B comprises at least one and in most instances a plurality of Virtual Input Output Server also referred to herein as a VIO Server or VIOS with functionality as described below. The actual number of VIOSes within each CEC of DPS is a design feature and may vary. Also supported within each CEC A B are client logical partitions interchangeably referred to as client LPARs or clients of which a first two clients clientA and clientB are illustrated. As described below with reference to client LPARs are logical partitions of a virtualized or operating system partitioned computing system. The actual number of clients within each CEC may vary and could range from a single client to hundreds or thousands of clients without limitation. For efficiency in presenting the inventive concepts herein only two clients are presented within each CEC of the various illustrative and described embodiments.

DPS also comprises a distributed storage facility accessible to each of the CECs and the components within the CECs . Within the described embodiments the distributed storage facility will be referred to as distributed storage repository and the distributed storage repository enables several of the client level functional features provided by the embodiments described herein. Distributed storage repository provides a single view of storage that is utilized by each CEC and for each client of each CEC within a cluster aware distributed system. Distributed storage repository comprises local physical storage and network storage both of which comprise multiple physical storage units e.g. disks. solid state drives etc. . The physical disks making up distributed storage repository may be distributed across a storage network e.g. a SAN . Additionally distributed storage repository provides a depository within which is stored and maintained the software utility instruction code OS images client images data system node and client level and or other functional information utilized in maintaining the client level system management and storage level operations features of DPS . In addition to distributed storage repository DPS also comprises a VIOS database DB which may also be a distributed storage facility comprising physical disks across a storage network. VIOS DB or DB is a repository that stores and provides access to various cluster configuration data and other functional components modules and data structures that enable the various cluster aware functionality described herein. In one embodiment portions of distributed storage repository may be allocated to provide storage pools for a cluster. Each VIOS of the cluster maintains a local view of the DB and updates the cluster level information data data structures within DB as such information data is created or updated.

Communication between each VIOS of each CEC as well as with the VIOSes of at least one other CEC is generally supported via a plurality of inter CEC interconnects illustrated as bi directional dashed lines connecting pairs of VIOSes . The arrows indicated two way data exchange or communication between components. In addition to the inter CEC interconnects each VIOS is also connected to distributed storage repository via VIOS to Store or CEC to Store interconnects which are also illustrated as full lined bi directional arrows. Also each VIOS is connected to DB via VIOS to DB interconnects presented as dashed and dotted lines. With the exception of the inter CEC connectors running from a first VIOS e.g. VIOS of a first CEC to a second VIOS e.g. VIOS on the same CEC the various interconnects represent a network level connectivity between the VIOS nodes of the cluster and the DB and the distributed storage repository . As utilized herein references to one or more nodes are assumed to refer specifically to a VIOS within the cluster. DPS also comprises a management console on which a management tool not shown executes.

Turning now to there is illustrated another view of DPS illustrating the network based connection of the CECs to the distributed storage repository and DB . illustrates in greater detail the network connectivity of VIOSes and CECs to each other and to Distributed storage repository . With this view CEC A Node A A and CEC B Node B B comprise similar constructs as presented in . Each CEC within DPS connects to distributed storage repository via one or more networks and or I O interconnect switch fabric generally illustrated as interconnect network fabric . The descriptions and illustrations assume that at least some of the CECs of DPS and distributed storage repository are located remotely from each other including being located in different countries for example such that no direct physical connectivity exists between the respective devices. For simplicity the embodiments are described as having primary interconnect network comprising a private wide area network WAN or a public WAN such as the Internet although other network types e.g. a local area network are possible and supported.

As depicted in one or more embodiments each CEC is also connected to one or more neighbor CECs in order to provide efficient fail over and or mobility support and other functions as described hereinafter. As utilized herein the term neighbor refers to a connected second CEC with which a first CEC is able to communicate and references to a neighbor CEC is not limited to a second CEC in geographic proximity to the first CEC. CEC A A and CEC B B are illustrated connected to each other via some connecting medium which may include a different network such as a local area network or some type of direct interconnect e.g. a fiber channel connection when physically close to each other. The connection between neighbor CECs A and B is illustrated as a direct line connection or a secondary network connection between CECs A and B. However it is appreciated that the connections are not necessarily direct and may actually be routed through the same general interconnect network as with the other CEC connections to distributed storage repository . In one or more alternate embodiments the connections between CECs may be via a different network e.g. network such as a local area network LAN .

Also illustrated by is an initial view of several of the functional and other components provided within an example distributed storage repository and an initial listing of some components of VIOS DB . As depicted each CEC comprises one or more network interfaces and one or more I O adapters to enable the CEC and thus the other components i.e. client partitions of the CEC to engage in network level communication as described below. Specifically each VIOS emulates virtual client I O adapters to enable communication by the client LPARs with distributed storage repository and or other clients within the same CEC or on a different CEC. The VIOSes emulate virtual I O adapters and communicates with distributed storage repository by connecting with corresponding virtual sever I O adapters at distributed storage repository . The VIOSes within each CEC are thus able to support client level access to distributed storage and enable the exchange of system level and client level information with distributed storage repository .

In addition each VIOS also comprises the functional components modules and data to enable the VIOSes within DPS to be aware of the other VIOSes anywhere within the cluster DPS . From this perspective the VIOSes are referred to herein as cluster aware and their interconnected structure within DPS thus enables DPS to also be interchangeably referred to as cluster aware DPS . As a part of being cluster aware each VIOS also connects to VIOS DB via network and communicates cluster level data with DB to support the cluster management functions described herein.

To support the virtual I O operations with the VIOSes and the associated virtual client I O adapters distributed storage repository comprises communication infrastructure . Communication infrastructure comprises network interface s and a plurality of server I O adapters utilized for cluster level communication and enabling access to data code software utility stored on distributed storage repository to complete I O operations thereto. Specifically these server I O adapters are also presented as virtual sever I O adapters which are paired with virtual I O adapters that are assigned to clients of CECs . As further shown with distributed storage repository DSR also comprises a plurality of software firmware and or software utility components including DSR configuration utility DSR configuration data e.g. inodes for basic file system access metadata authentication and other processes and DSR management utility .

To support the cluster awareness features of the DPS and in accordance with the illustrative embodiment distributed storage repository also comprises VIOS database DB in which is stored various data structures generated during set up and or subsequent processing of the VIOS cluster connected processing components e.g. VIOSes and management tool . VIOS DB comprises a plurality of software or firmware components and or and data data modules or data structures several of which are presented in for illustration. Among these components are cluster management CM utility VIO AdapterID data structure cluster configuration data Client identifying ID data active nodes list and I O redundancy data among others. Additionally VIOS DB comprises primary node election data modules which are a plurality of different functional components and data that are utilized during an election of a primary node VIOS from among the various nodes in the VIOS cluster. The actual makeup of primary node election data modules is described in detail with the description of presented below. These various components support the various clustering functionality and cluster aware I O operations of the one or more VIOSes as described herein. Additional features of VIOS DB and distributed storage repository as well as the specific components or sub components that enable the various clustering functionality are presented within the description of the remaining figures and throughout the description of the various embodiments.

In one embodiment the initial set up of the storage pools VIOS DB and corresponding data structures is activated by execution of a cluster aware operating system by management tool . Once the infrastructure has been established however maintenance of the infrastructure including expanding the number of nodes where required is performed by the VIOSes in communication with DB and the management tool .

Also associated with DPS of and communicatively coupled to distributed storage repository and DB and VIOSes is management console which may be utilized by an administrator of DPS or of distributed storage repository or DB to access DB or distributed storage repository and configure resources and functionality of DB and of distributed storage repository for access usage by the VIOSes and clients of the connected CECs within the cluster. As shown in and described throughout the specification management tool is implemented within management console . However it is appreciated that resources of any node within DPS may be selected elected to perform the functions of management tool and the selected node would then perform one or more of the below described cluster creation and the other cluster monitoring and management functions utilizing the availability of the resources provided by DB and distributed storage repository .

In an alternate embodiment management tool is an executable module that is executed within a client partition at one of the CECs within DPS . In one embodiment the management tool controls some of the operations of the VIOS cluster and may enable each node within the cluster to maintain current updated information regarding the cluster including providing notification of any changes made to one or more of the nodes within the cluster.

With reference now to there is presented a third view of an example DPS emphasizing a processing system architecture i.e. architecture of the individual CECs and specifically CEC A A . CEC A A CEC A serves as the example CEC that is described in greater detail in and throughout the specification. CEC A is presented as a server that comprises hardware components and software firmware OS components that are logically partition to create a plurality of virtualized machine partitions which are assigned as client logical partitions LPARs and virtual I O servers VIOSes . Hardware components of example CEC A comprises one or more processors A P one or more memories A M and local storage . The processors A P are interconnected with one or a plurality of memories A M and with local storage via a bus interconnect switch or an interconnect fabric not specifically shown . The specific internal connectivity of components which may be distributed across a large scale interconnect fabric is not germane to the described embodiments and no further detail is presented regarding the particular type of interconnectivity between the system hardware components.

Also included within hardware components are one or more physical network interfaces by which CEC A A connects to an external network such as network among others. Additionally hardware components comprise a plurality of I O adapters A E which provides the I O interface for CEC A A. I O adapters A E are physical adapters that enable CEC A to support I O operations via an I O interface with both locally connected and remotely networked connected I O devices including SF storage . Examples of I O adapters include Peripheral Component Interface PCI PCI X or PCI Express Adapter and Small Computer System Interconnect SCSI adapters among others. CEC is logically partitioned such that different I O adapters are virtualized and the virtual I O adapters may then be uniquely assigned to different logical partitions.

Logically located above the hardware level is a virtualization management component provided as a Power Hypervisor PHYP trademark of IBM Corporation as one embodiment. While illustrated and described throughout the various embodiments as PHYP it is fully appreciated that other types of virtualization management components may be utilized and are equally applicable to the implementation of the various embodiments. PHYP has an associated service processor coupled thereto within CEC . Service processor may be used to provide various services for one or more logical partitions. PHYP is also coupled to hardware management controller HMC which exists outside of the physical CEC . Operations of the different logical partitions may be controlled through HMC which is a separate data processing system from which a system administrator may perform various functions such as reallocation of resources to different logical partitions.

CEC A A further comprises a plurality of user level logical partitions LPARs of which a first two are shown represented as individual client LPARs A B within CEC A. According to the various illustrative embodiments CEC A supports multiple clients and other functional operating OS partitions that are created within a virtualized environment. Each LPAR e.g. client LPAR A receives an allocation of specific virtualized hardware and OS resources including virtualized CPU A Memory A OS A local firmware and local storage LStore . Each client LPAR includes a respective host operating system that controls low level access to hardware layer of CEC A and or to virtualized I O functions and or services provided through VIOSes . In one embodiment the operating system s may be implemented using OS which is designed to interface with a partition management firmware such as PHYP and is available from International Business Machines Corporation. It is appreciated that other types of operating systems such as Advanced Interactive Executive AIX operating system a trademark of IBM Corporation Microsoft Windows a trademark of Microsoft Corp or GNU Linux registered trademarks of the Free Software Foundation and The Linux Mark Institute for example may be utilized depending on a particular implementation and OS is used only as an example.

Additionally according to the illustrative embodiment CEC A also comprises one or more VIOSes of which two VIOS A and B are illustrated. In one embodiment each VIOS is configured within one of the memories A M and comprises virtualized versions of hardware components including CPU memory local storage and I O adapters among others. According to one embodiment each VIOS is implemented as a logical partition LPAR that owns specific network and disk I O adapters. Each VIOS also represents a single purpose dedicated LPAR. The VIOS facilitates the sharing of physical I O resources between client logical partitions. Each VIOS allows other OS LPARs which may be referred to as VIO Clients or as Clients to utilize the physical resources of the VIOS via a pair of virtual adapters. Thus VIOS provides virtual small computer system interface SCSI target and shared network adapter capability to client LPARs within CEC . As provided herein VIOS supports Virtual real memory and Virtual shared storage functionality with access to Distributed storage repository as well as clustering functionality.

Within CEC A VIOSes and client LPARs utilize an internal virtual network to communicate. This communication is implemented by API calls to the memory of the PHYP . The VIOS then bridges the virtual network to the physical I O adapter to allow the client LPARs to communicate externally. The client LPARs are thus able to be connected and inter operate fully in a VLAN environment.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware firmware software utility and software components and basic configuration thereof depicted in B and may vary. The illustrative components of DPS and specifically those within CEC A are not intended to be exhaustive but rather are representative to highlight some of the components that are utilized to implement certain of the described embodiments. For example different configurations of data processing systems CECs devices may be provided containing other devices components which may be used in addition to or in place of the hardware depicted and may be differently configured. The depicted example is not meant to imply architectural or other limitations with respect to the presently described embodiments and or the general invention. The CEC depicted in the various figures may be for example an IBM eServer pSeries system a product of International Business Machines Corporation in Armonk N.Y. running the Advanced Interactive Executive AIX operating system or LINUX operating system.

Certain of the features associated with the implementation of a cluster aware VIOS e.g. VIOS of B and are introduced above with reference to the description of the previous figures and particularly . Descriptions of the specific functionality of the VIOS will continue to be provided with reference to the illustrations of B and . As presented by each VIOS is a virtual machine instance that emulates hardware in a virtualized environment. The VIOS is tasked with emulating SCSI storage devices and the VIOS provides client LPARs with access to distributed storage repository in cooperation with the PHYP . Configuration of the VIOS is performed through the hardware management tools of HMC . SCSI storage devices support a set of commands that allow SCSI initiators the ability to control access to storage . Database programs for example may manage access to distributed storage repository through a set of SCSI commands commonly referred to as persistent reserve. Other types of reserves are also supported by VIOS and the collective group of such commands is referred to herein as reserve commands.

As provided herein each VIOS allows sharing of physical I O resources between client LPARs including sharing of virtual Small Computer Systems Interface SCSI and virtual networking These I O resources may be presented as internal or external SCSI or SCSI with RAID adapters or via Fibre Channel adapters to distributed storage repository . The client LPAR however uses the virtual SCSI device drivers. In one embodiment the VIOS also provides disk virtualization for the client LPAR by creating a corresponding file on distributed storage repository for each virtual disk. The VIOS allows more efficient utilization of physical resources through sharing between client LPARs and supports a single machine e.g. CEC to run multiple operating system OS images concurrently and isolated from each other.

In one or more embodiments the VIOS operating system s is an enhanced OS that includes cluster aware functionality and is thus referred to as a cluster aware OS CA OS . One embodiment for example utilizes cluster aware AIX CAA as the operating system. According to one embodiment cluster awareness enables multiple independent physical systems to be operated and managed as a single system. As provided within VIOS of CEC A VIOS comprises cluster aware CA OS kernel or simply CA OS as well as LPAR function code for performing OS kernel related functions for the VIOS LPARs . When executed within two or more nodes of DPS CA OS enables various clustering functions such as forming a cluster adding members to a cluster and removing members from a cluster as described in greater detail below. CA OS manages the VIOS LPARs and enables the VIOSes within a cluster to be cluster aware. CA OS comprises several functional modules. In the described embodiments CA OS comprises cluster management CM utility which supports the configuration of the VIOS to enable cluster awareness and cluster level functionality such as redundant virtual I O. Each of these additional software components of CA OS may be a functional module within CM utility in one embodiment and each module is thus described as such throughout the remainder of this specification. In one embodiment CM utility may be a separate utility that is locally installed or downloaded from DB for example as an enhancement to an existing OS within a CEC or VIOS when initially configured for operation within the VIOS cluster. CM utility is then executed when configuring the individual VIOS to create or join a cluster and or become a cluster aware node within the VIOS cluster. With this implementation structure CM utility enables the OS to support the various cluster awareness and other cluster level features and functionality. In an alternate embodiment CA OS includes all the clustering features and functionality and established the various features when the CEC VIOS joins the cluster and or during configuration of VIOS to become cluster aware.

In one implementation functional components of CM utility are encoded on local device storage of a corresponding VIOS such that the VIOS becomes automatically configured as a part of the VIOS cluster when the VIOS is initially activated. On initial set up of the VIOS VIOS API kernel extensions and virtual adapters are configured within VIOS to enable communication with the other VIOSes the VIOS DB and with the distributed storage repository . During this initial setup of the VIOS the VIOS executes a registration module of CM utility to register VIOS with the cluster. The registration module enables VIOS to retrieve download or have forwarded from DB on successful registration with the cluster any additional CM software components and or cluster level information and or data required to establish full cluster awareness when the VIOS has completed installation and is activated within the CEC . Thus in one embodiment in addition to the locally stored CA OS components and software modules of CM utility other functional components of CM utility may be downloaded from DB when CEC is powered on or when one or more VIOSes are enabled on CEC . Once the VIOS has completed its setup one or more client LPARs that are activated within CEC may be assigned to VIOS and VIOS subsequently performs the various I O operations initiated by the client as initiator or directed to the client as target . Updates to the local VIOS data may periodically be made as changes are made within the VIOS cluster and or as one or more new client LPARs are added to the CEC requiring VIOS support. In one embodiment CM utility may also enable retrieval and presentation of a comprehensive view of the resources of the entire cluster.

It is appreciated that while various functional aspects of the clustering operations are described as separate components modules and or utility and associated data constructs the entire grouping of different components utility data may be provided by a single executable utility application such as CA OS or CM utility . Thus in one embodiment CA OS executes within VIOS and generates a plurality of functional components within VIOS and within DB . Several of these functional components are introduced within and and others are described throughout the various embodiments provided herein. For simplicity in the descriptions which follow references to CM utility and CA OS will be assumed to be referring to the same general component i.e. CM utility being a subcomponent of CA OS and the terms may be utilized interchangeably throughout the specification.

As further presented by the illustrative embodiments e.g. VIOS includes one or more additional functional modules components such as VIO adapter s interface and virtual I O drivers utility which provides I O functionality to VIOS and enables VIOS to route data traffic to and from data structures and storage within distributed storage repository and or DB . Virtual I O adapter s and CM utility also enable the VIOS to provide each client LPAR with access to the full range of storage accessible within distributed storage repository and other cluster supported functionalities as described herein.

In the illustrative embodiment each client LPAR communicates with VIOS via PHYP . VIOS and client LPAR A B are logically coupled to PHYP which enables supports communication between both virtualized structures. Each component forwards information to PHYP and PHYP then routes data between the different components in physical memory A M . In one embodiment a virtualized interface of I O adapters is also linked to PHYP such that I O operations can be communicated between the different logical partitions and one or more local and or remote I O devices. As with local I O routing data traffic coming in and or out of I O adapter interface or network interface from a remote I O device is passed to the specific VIOS via PHYP .

With the above introduced system configuration of B and A a first VIOS through a communication channel established via PHYP grants access to another VIOS through one or more virtual adapters. VIOS includes the functionality to query PHYP for the identity of the Client LPAR on the CEC where the VIOS is currently running

With the cluster aware VIOS infrastructure different VIOSes associated with different CECs access the distributed storage repository and cluster level information is shared communicated across the VIOS cluster via VIOS DB while each client I O process is being performed. In this manner the VIOS associated with a first client on a first CEC is aware of which SAN disk resources are being accessed by a second client on a second CEC or on the same CEC . With this awareness factored into the I O exchange with the distributed storage repository the VIOS associated with the first client can avoid accessing the same storage resource that is concurrently being utilized by the second client thus preventing data integrity issues which could potentially cause data corruption and client partition crashes.

In one embodiment VIOS functionality is enhanced to enable assigning of client identifiers ID and unique virtual I O adapter IDs in a secure manner while enabling storage pooling within virtual storage within distributed storage repository . According to the described implementation the different clientID vioAdapterID pairings are unique throughout the cluster so that no two clients throughout the entire cluster can share a same virtual adapter and no two vioAdapterIDs are the same within a single client. is a flow chart illustrating the method by which a VIOS on a CEC with DPS enables cluster level communication between a client LPAR and distributed storage repository according to one embodiment. The process begins at block at which the VIOS queries PHYP for the identity of the client LPAR . At block the VIOS creates a unique identifier ID for the client i.e. a ClientID . The VIOS then stores the unique ClientID in ClientID data structure within DB block . The DB and by extension the ClientID data structure are accessible to each VIOS partition in the cooperating cluster DPS . At block the VIOS also generates an identifier for each virtual IT nexus virtual I O AdapterID that is utilized for each virtual adapter assigned to the client LPAR . In one embodiment a client LPAR can have multiple virtual adapters assigned thereto. These vio AdapterIDs are stored in the AdapaterID data structure block and are associated with their corresponding clientIDs block . The method illustrated by ends at termination block with each clientID having been associated with the corresponding one or more vio AdapterIDs with DB .

As described herein a cluster is a set of one or more networked VIOS partitions where each VIOS within the cluster has access to a common set of physical volumes. The physical volume resides within the VIOS cluster and is utilized to provide block storage. Implementation of the cluster awareness with the VIOSes of the cluster enables the VIOSes to provide cluster storage services to virtual clients client LPARs . The VIOS software stack provides the following advanced capabilities among others Storage Aggregation and Provisioning Thin Provisioning Virtual Client Cloning Virtual Client Snapshot Virtual Client Migration Distributed Storage Repository Virtual Client Mirroring and Server Management Infrastructure integration. More generally the VIOS protocol allows distributed storage to be viewed as centralized structured storage with a namespace location transparency serialization and fine grain security. The VIOS protocol provides storage pooling distributed storage and consistent storage virtualization interfaces and capabilities across heterogeneous SAN and network accessible storage NAS . In order to provide block storage services utilizing the distributed repository each VIOS configures virtual devices to be exported to virtual clients. Once each virtual device is successfully configured and mapped to a virtual host VHOST adapter the clients may begin utilizing the devices as needed. In one embodiment the virtualization is performed utilizing POWER virtual machine VM virtualization technology which allows the device configuration process to occur seamlessly because the physical block storage is always accessible from the OS partition.

One embodiment provides a communication protocol that enables efficient communication between the Clients and distributed storage repository via the respective VIOS and virtual I O adapters assigned within the VIOSes to the specific client . The embodiment further provides storage virtualization and management via the specific communication mechanisms protocols implemented with respect to the use of cluster awareness and the Distributed storage repository such that the virtualization is presented within the context of the server CEC virtualization and management. With the presented protocol different VIOSes associated with different CECs access the same single distributed DB and cluster level information is shared communicated with each Client I O process such that a first client on a first CEC is aware of which SAN disk resources are being accessed by a second client on a second CEC or on the same CEC . With this awareness factored into the I O exchange with the distributed storage repository the first client can avoid accessing the same storage resource that is concurrently being utilized by the second client thus preventing data integrity issues which would potentially cause data corruption and client partition crashes.

The communication protocol provides a highly integrated server based storage virtualization as well as distributed storage across clustered VIOS partitions. This protocol comprises one or more query features which enables dynamic tracking of storage resource usage across the entire cluster. Throughout the following description the communication and management protocol shall be described as a VIOS protocol. VIOS protocol provides distributed storage across clustered VIOS partitions. With the VIOS protocol the storage is considered as a one large storage pool which chunks of storage i.e. logical units or LUs allocated to each client . The VIOSes within the overall system DPS are now structured as part of the cluster with each VIOS being a node in the cluster. Each VIOS node communicates with other VIOS nodes utilizing the VIOS protocol. With this configuration of VIOSes when two or more client LPARs belonging to different CECs share storage on the SAN e.g. two clients assigned overlapping LUs the VIOS protocol enables each node to query each client within the cluster to determine the current usage of the storage device. When this information is received the VIOS may then disseminate this information to other VIOSes. Each client is thus made aware of whether the SAN storage device that the client is trying to access is currently being used by some other client.

Referring now to there is illustrated an example VIOS communication infrastructure having an application programming interface API controlling the various exchanges between XML components over a virtual Small Computing Systems Interface vSCSI topology. Central to the Cluster VIOS communication paradigm is a plurality of APIs of which API is provided in the illustrative embodiment. The VIOS API is utilized to manage objects within a VIOS cluster. The API includes the necessary information about how to connect to and or exchange information with internal VIOS functional modules as well as with DB DDS and management tool . In one embodiment management tool is implemented within a cluster aware server module and includes server management sub agents which represents the structures utilized by the managing tool to communicate with the operating system. The internal functional modules within VIOS comprises command line interface CLI Daemon socket kernel extension vKE and vSCSI host . The vSCSCI host includes the enhancements to VIOS that enable the cluster aware functionality. These enhancements are illustrated as a connected block structure by which advanced VIOS operations and emulation are provided as described in greater detail below. VIOS with its various internal components is connected within CEC via PHYP as previously illustrated by described above.

Each component that connects with API and makes one or more requests through API is generally referred to as a caller throughout this specification. As presented by the figure any one or management tool via management agent CLI Daemon and vSCSI host may be a caller requesting specific types of information exchange via API . In one embodiment the API comprises an XML interface as well as a C programming language interface. The various callers use the VIOS API to initiate actions on these objects. Some actions may change the state of one or more objects in the VIOS cluster. The VIOS API may be used by multiple callers at any given time. While callers are not aware of other callers using the VIOS API and do not have the ability to notify all callers of actions that they initiate the VIOS API event notification protocol provides cluster level awareness of caller modifications to prevent data contamination during processing of multiple caller requests. Callers that need awareness of actions taken on VIO objects are able to register for event notification and receive notification about changes to VIO objects that occur within the cluster. The callers then utilize the notifications as a trigger to go to the shared storage DB and retrieve the necessary information from the shared VIOS cluster DB to keep the caller s locally stored VIO object data current. Additionally in one embodiment VIOS API event notification provides participating callers with results to actions that have occurred on one or more VIO objects. As described herein these VIO object events are categorized as Lifecycle events or Alert events.

In one embodiment to decrease the amount of APIs required be each consumer only a few high level APIs are exposed. Each API provides various actions on an object by object basis. Interaction between the API and a consumer a caller receiving data in response to a requestor a caller registered to receive notification of an event is performed by the consumer providing a VIO request extensible markup language XML buffer with sufficient amount of data provided in order for the request to be processed. Once the request has been processed a VIO response XML steam is written back to the caller for response processing. When the response indicates a successful processing of the request the XML steam contains the status and the requested object information that is needed. However if the request fails the response XML stream contains VIO exception information. The common format of each object API is to provide a vioRequest structure that contains the required information needed for request processing.

Returning to in the illustrative embodiments a VIOS emulates SCSI devices using a kernel extension vscsi host kernel extension kernel extension in the VIOS partition which also includes the code modules for providing VCSI host and Daemon . VSCSI host includes one or more driver s and sub driver s which provide separate functions. A first set of drivers provides emulation functionality while other drivers provide transport and messaging functionality. VSCSI host includes VIOS enhanced operational functionality illustrated via additional structure4 coupled to VSCSI host . Structure includes software modules that enable the various messaging structures used for implementing VIOS cluster awareness functionality and VIOS Client emulation. Client logs into the VIOS as part of the transport layer protocol. At the time the client logs into the VIOS the PHYP provides information to the VIOS regarding the identity ID of the client relative to the CEC . The VKE services SCSI requests sent by the VIOS through a transport layer supported by PHYP . The kernel code does not complete the login request until the VKE sends a message with the CEC relative client ID using a socket to Daemon which is also running on the VIOS . VKE also transmits other messages within the cluster environment. The user daemon has access through API to Database DB which is maintained by all VIOS partitions servicing the client s within the cluster.

As described herein implementation of the cluster awareness with the VIOSes of the cluster enables the VIOSes to provide cluster storage services to virtual clients . The VIOS software stack provides the following advanced capabilities among others Storage Aggregation and Provisioning Thin Provisioning Virtual Client Cloning Virtual Client Snapshot Virtual Client Migration Distributed Storage Repository Virtual Client Mirroring and Server Management Infrastructure integration. More generally the VIOS protocol allows distributed storage to be viewed as centralized structured storage with a namespace location transparency serialization and fine grain security. The VIOS protocol provides storage pooling distributed storage and consistent storage virtualization interfaces and capabilities across heterogeneous SAN and network accessible storage NAS . In order to provide block storage services utilizing the distributed repository each VIOS configures virtual devices to be exported to virtual clients. Once each virtual device is successfully configured and mapped to a virtual host VHOST adapter the clients may begin utilizing the devices as needed. In one embodiment the virtualization is performed utilizing POWER virtual machine VM virtualization technology which allows the device configuration process to occur seamlessly because the physical block storage is always accessible from the OS partition. When a virtual target device is removed the local OS cache local storage data entries are deleted. Within the clustered environment removal of any of the LUs is noticed to the other VIOSes. According to the described method a distributed device repository and local repository cache are utilized to ensure the nodes within the cluster become device level synchronized from each node VIOS in the cluster.

According to one embodiment information needed to configure a virtual target device VTD is stored in DB . This database DB can be accessed by all the nodes in the VIOS cluster utilizing services provided by Cluster Aware OS such as but not limited to Cluster Aware AIX CAA . Additionally certain small levels of cluster data are stored in a local database ODM e.g. virtualized portions of storage on each node for the devices which exist on that node. This local storage is necessary in order for the processes running on the local node to be able to match the VIOS device with the correct information in the distributed database.

With information about each device being stored in the DB operations on those devices can be performed from any VIOS node in the cluster not just the node on which the device resides. When an operation on a device is performed on a remote non local node i.e. one other than the node where the device physically resides the operation is able to make any changes to the device s information in the DB as necessary. When corresponding changes are needed in the device s local database the corresponding CM utility enables the remote node to send a message using cluster services to the local node to notify the local node to make the required changes. Additionally when a node in the cluster is booted up or when the node rejoins the cluster after having been lost for any period of time the node will autonomously reference the DB in order to synchronize the data there with the local data of the node.

As an example if an operation to delete a VIOS device from the local node is executed on a remote node the operation will remove the information associated with that device from the DB and send a message to the local node to tell the local node to remove the device from the local database. If the local node is down or not currently a part of the cluster when the local node first boots up or rejoins the cluster the local node will automatically access the DB retrieve current data information that indicates that the information for one of the local devices has been removed and delete that device from the local database records.

Due to the potentially large number of VIOSes within the VIOS cluster one or more embodiments provide a mechanism methodology for managing events and actions within the system. According to one embodiment a system and method are provided by which the various nodes within the VIOS cluster detect when there is a need for a primary node elect a primary node and subsequently trigger another election of a next primary node when needed. With this embodiment the election process involves utilizing VIOS DB and the message passing functionality enabled by the VIOS cluster to ensure that whenever possible there is a primary node assigned to maintain and provide cluster information about the nodes within the cluster and to the nodes. In the following descriptions references made to a specific Primary Node will be directed to VIOS A of . One or more of VIOS B or VIOS C then represents the secondary nodes described within the following description.

Referring again to VIOS DB comprises a plurality of functional structures modules and or data associated with the primary node election process described herein. As shown VIOS DB comprises primary node ID and elector ID both of which provides specific functions defined hereafter. Additionally each VIOS comprises a plurality of components that supports the primary node secondary node configuration of a VIOS cluster. As provided within CA OS kernel of each VIOS is cluster registration utility and CM utility . CM utility then comprises node monitor report utility liveliness notifications and alerts . When a VIOS is configured to operate as a primary node that VIOS also comprises primary node election operation utility and either or both primary notification module and primary clean up module . As further presented by VIOS DB may also comprise alert journal Message Alert notification subscriber list and clean up data module .

Utilization of a primary node provides a benefit of scalability for cluster environments in large configurations. According to one embodiment the VIOS cluster environment incorporates role specific VIOS nodes that provide services to other VIOS nodes in the cluster. Among the roles and associated functionality that are provided by one or more VIOS nodes are the roles of posting life cycle events posting alerts journaling alerts and providing Database and general clean up among others. In one embodiment each role can be performed by a separate primary node such that an unlimited number of primary nodes may be defined within the cluster. The number of primary nodes can be based on the functionality needed and each function could in one or more embodiments have a separate primary node assigned to perform that particular function. According to the illustrative embodiment and as illustrated by the above roles are provided by two primary nodes Primary Notification node and Primary Clean up node . Each node that is elected to the role of primary node first meets specific pre established requirements. Assigning a VIOS the role of primary node is provided through an election process which is generally illustrated by the flow charts of .

Turning now to the method of the primary node election process begins at block . In the presented embodiment a first VIOS node detects that a primary node election is needed and the first node initiates the election process. When the node detects block that an election is needed the node checks its own configuration parameters against the requirements published for a node to become the primary node block . The node determines at decision block whether the node itself meets the requirements e.g. by having a pre established set of primary node modules data configuration to allow the node to become the primary node. If the node does not meet the established requirements the node becomes the elector node and activates a discovery process that discovers and notifies a next node e.g. from within the elector order list of the need for a primary node . The next node may then become the candidate node if the next node meets the requirements to become a candidate. When the node meets the established requirements block the node determines at block whether the primary node ID field is locked in the VIOS DB by another node. If the primary node ID field is locked the node sets a primary node election timer block to track the elapsed time since the node last attempted to become the primary node. The timer expires after an amount of time e.g. a pre set time period elapses that is either a design choice or dynamically determined based on the number of nodes within the cluster and or other quantifiable factors step . Assuming that no other node has locked the primary node ID field the node locks the Primary Node ID field within VIOS DB and the node initiates the primary node commit process block . At block the node sends a COMMIT signal to VIOS DB and updates the primary node ID field with the node s own unique ID. The node then unlocks the Primary Node ID field block . In one embodiment the features of block are performed as a part of the COMMIT process of block .

When the established primary node prepares to take any primary node specific actions the primary node first generates and issues a query to VIOS DB to ensure that the node is still the primary node before the node takes the action block . For example before the primary notification node posts a life cycle event LCE the node will issue a query to VIOS DB and specifically to check the value of the Primary Node ID stored within the Primary Node ID field to confirm that the node is still the Notification Primary Node i.e. checking that the node s ID matches that stored as the Primary Node ID . Returning to decision block a check is made at block whether another node has committed as the primary node. If another node has committed as the primary the node retrieves the primary node ID from the primary node ID field and updates the node s local copy of the primary node ID block . The method process then ends at block .

According to the protocol for electing a primary node if the Primary Node ID field is locked then all other nodes that attempt to read the primary node ID field will receive a busy return value. When the node receives the busy response the node sets an election timer. If during the election process the current elector node determines that the node does not meet the one or more requirements to be a primary node the elector node performs the task of discovering a next candidate. First the elector node retrieves the list of active nodes in the cluster. The elector node then communicates with the next active node in the list starting with the next entry after the elector node s own entry in the list . Receipt of this communication prompts the next node in the list to begin the election process. The election process in completed one node at a time until a suitable primary node is elected.

In one or more embodiments the elector node sends a message to the candidate node to determine if the candidate node is capable of becoming the primary node. If the candidate node is capable it elects itself as the primary node for the specified role. If the message to the candidate node fails to be received and or acknowledged then the elector node repeats the process for the next node in the ordered list . When a primary node no longer meets the requirements to be a primary node the node undertakes the process or relinquishing the primary role. The process involves the primary node updating the Primary Node ID in VIOS DB to a null zero value and discovering the next candidate in the ordered list as previously described.

Referring to which begins at block when a next node is selected as the primary the current node performs a series of additional processes. The node first detects or receives a message notification at block that there is a new primary node ID within the primary node ID field at the VIOS DB . The node immediately stops its election timer where a timer was previously set at block . The node then updates its local primary node ID that is maintained in local storage with the primary node ID retrieved from the VIOS DB block .

In one or more embodiments as illustrated by the method of when a node that is the primary node no longer meets the requirements to be the primary node the node resets the primary node ID within the VIOS DB to a null zero value. The node also sends a message to inform the other nodes in the cluster to initiate the election process. In one embodiment the current primary node informs the other nodes of the need for electing a new primary node by the current primary node updating the primary node ID in the VIOS DB to a zero null value and then broadcasting a primary node election message so that the other nodes that meet one or more primary node criteria can initiate the election process. In an embodiment where different primary nodes can be elected to perform different roles and or embodiments in which certain nodes can only perform certain primary roles the broadcasted message includes indentifying information about the primary role that is being relinquished e.g. a notification role a cleanup role .

As introduced above during the primary node election process the non elector nodes i.e. the nodes that do not currently have a lock on the primary node ID field monitors the elapsed time of the election process by initiating their respective timers. The timer is started by a node when the node receives a primary node election start message and or when the node receives a busy value when trying to read the Primary Node ID from VIOS DB . The timer is stopped by the node when a new elected primary can be detected. If no new primary is detected then the node initiates the election process at the expiration of the timer to attempt to become the primary node.

With the method of if the node has started a timer during the election process the node must first query the value of the Primary Node ID from the VIOS DB and the node must then determine if the Primary Node ID at the VIOS DB is the same as the primary node ID stored in the node local memory. In one embodiment the node also checks if the Elector Node ID is set. If the Elector Node ID is not set the node assumes that the previous elector has been unable to complete the election and the node sets the Elector Node ID and initiates an election process. If the Primary Node ID from VIOS DB is different than the primary node ID stored in node local memory or the Elector ID is 0 the node establishes itself as the elector node and sets the node s unique ID as the new Elector ID. Also when a recent primary node receives a notification or response indicating that the node is no longer the primary node the node will automatically update the node s internal value of the primary node ID to the new primary node ID retrieved from VIOS DB block . The node also stops the election timer if one was initiated. With the above confirmation step performed prior to any node undertaking a primary node task there is no need for the node to receive an election success or confirmation message in response to a commitment signal.

During an election of a Primary Event Node when a socket connection e.g. TCP socket UNIX socket etc. to the required callers does not exist the node sends a registration message request to a defined UNIX socket for the caller to register a socket. Also during the election process any LCE that arrives at VIOS DB will be lost. Then following its election as the primary node the node that wins the election process issues a resend re synchronize message to the caller s whose LCE was lost during the primary node election process.

Once the primary node is elected the primary node undertakes to perform several tasks functions dependent on the services the primary node provides. An example of these tasks functions are a notification function by which the primary node broadcasts an election complete message with an election success status including the primary node s ID and primary node role e.g. notification or and cleanup role to the other VIOSes within the cluster. This broadcast is only performed by the newly elected primary node. Each non primary secondary node that receives this message updates the node s local memory with the new Primary Node ID and the non primary node also stops any election timing the node may have initiated. Another task function performed by the newly elected primary node involves taking role specific actions. Specifically a Primary Notification Node issues the caller resynchronization message request to the caller on the socket after the election completion message is returned. This resynchronization notification is needed because any events that occur during the election process may be lost. Also the Primary notification node listens to and posts Alerts. The Primary Cleanup Node performs the tasks of gathering the active node list and take actions based on inactive nodes cleaning up database entries performing clean up based on journal entries future and listens to and journals alerts. Once a primary node is elected the non primary nodes automatically stop their respective election process timers and load the new Primary Node ID into their respective node local memory. In one embodiment the Primary Notification node reads the journaled alerts and posts all alerts that occurred during the election process to management tools.

When the primary node election process fails to result in a primary node being elected the election process is tagged as failed and the cluster management utility generates and issues a notification to the management console . This failure only occurs when the process has exhausted the entire elector order list without finding a suitable primary node. In one embodiment the original elector node ID is saved in VIOS DB and can be checked to verify that the list has been exhausted. Generating an indication of a failure of the election process involves clearing the elector ID field in VIOS DB . The elector node logs an error to indicate that services provided by the primary role are not available at the current time. Non primary nodes then clear the Primary Node ID from their respective local memories which coincides with the individual nodes also checking whether the node meets the requirements for the primary node role in order to re initiate the election process. The presence of a Primary Node ID of zero at the node indicates that the primary node has not been elected.

According to the described embodiments one or more triggers initiate the primary node election process when there is no primary node elected or the present primary node cannot fulfill the primary node role. Among these triggers are those presented within the following non exclusive list 

Whenever a primary node or an elector node goes down is no longer functional the alert handler starts re election of the respective primary node. Also if the election timer expires which may indicate that the cluster heartbeat may have a problem the election process is restarted. With each election restart the node first compares what the node last recorded as the primary node ID with the Primary Node ID in VIOS DB .
