title: Agency management system and content management system integration
abstract: An agency management and content management integration system links agency management system domain entities (such as clients, policies, claims, vendors) to content management system content hierarchical structures (such as client files, policy folders, claims folders, vendor files). End users can quickly navigate to the appropriate content management system structure or structures when working with an entity in the agency management system via button integration. The agency management and content management integration system automatically creates and updates the content management system when changes are made to the agency management system. This may include providing multiple mappings between the entities of the insurance agency management system and content hierarchical structures, a preview of changes to the content hierarchical structures, a testing environment to test the content hierarchical structure changes, and troubleshooting logs resulting from testing of the content hierarchical structure. Also provided are systems to create appropriate initial content management system hierarchical structures when the agency management system already exists, and to update existing structures en masse if desired.

Insurance agency management systems are specialized to handle the domain of insurance business processes. Content management systems are specialized to handle content and workflow. Each of these systems is useful to an insurance agency and many agencies choose to operate both types of systems. There are many insurance business activities that would benefit from interaction with both the agency management system and the content management system for example printing out an insurance application for an insurance carrier and saving a copy for the agency s records . Often this involves entering information in both systems and learning to navigate in the two systems. As standalone applications this creates a burden of work for the user who has to make sure to precisely enter information into both systems and in the correct location in both of the systems. Because of the flexibility of content management systems and complexity of agency management systems this can be a very tedious and time consuming task that is prone to human error resulting in a cost to the business.

The agency management and content management integration system is a system which provides easy navigation linking and indexing with automatic content structure creation.

When an agency has both an agency management system and a content management system it is advantageous to integrate these programs so that the user has to copy less data by hand which is time consuming and prone to error and omission . Integration may also allow the users to quickly navigate between the agency management system and the content management system. Integration may additionally provide for the creation of content structures before there is a need to use the content structure. This may advantageously allow a user to immediately organize content and skip the content structure creation phase of their work. This may be especially valuable if the particular workflow does not start in the agency management system. By automatically creating content structures in a hierarchical fashion the agency can deploy a unified organization structure that is enforced automatically across the organization. By providing an external integration the content management system and agency management systems can be developed independently retaining the benefits of specialization while the integration pulls the two parts together.

The embodiments can be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks or modules are performed by remote processing devices which are linked through a communications network such as network . In a distributed computing environment program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.

Previously attempts have been made to include light weight i.e. lacking full functionality content management systems into agency management systems to mitigate costs but these systems cannot compete with a full content management and workflow system. It is more valuable to have the two specialized systems than to have one system and a light weight version of the other. Advantageously the embodiments described herein integrate the two specialized systems such that the end user which could be an insurance manager executive sales representative customer service representative account manager or even mail indexer gains productivity and data robustness reducing the cost to the business.

Additionally some previous attempts have been made to include a completely user driven integration. However sometimes a user s workflow does not originate in the agency management system but because the content management system would require the integration to be pushed from the agency management system the user would have to enter the agency management system start the integration and then move back to the content management system. Advantageously the embodiments described herein immediately reflect changes in the agency management system in the content management system.

Using the integration layer the agency management and content management integration system allows automatic generation of content structure in the content management system for various agency management system domain entities for example insurance entities such as clients submissions policies claims quotes vendors employees staff members companies carriers and transactional elements activities tasks notes etc. . The agency management and content management integration system provides linking between the agency management system entity to the appropriate content management system structure or structures through a well defined mapping process as explained in more detail with reference to below . Fast navigation is provided between the agency management system and content management system to reduce the amount of manual data entry by the user thus reducing human error.

The agency management and content management integration system also executes automatic data entry into the content management system to assist content management system workflow processes. Specifically agency management and content management integration system provides automatic data synchronization into the content management system so that data stays current in the content management system even when the agency management system is changing. Hierarchical content structures are automatically generated by the agency management and content management integration system so that an agency can automatically deploy an organizational structure to their end users. This organizational structure is deployed by organizing content based on domain entity criteria such as business unit coverage type entity type etc. and by supporting multiple agencies including multiple agency management system environments.

Also multiple content management system structure divisions for the same entities are dynamically provided. For example one entity may exist in multiple structures in the content management system based on certain domain criteria like business unit or coverage type and a flexible mapping of entities to content structures is used to support the various organizational strategies of different insurance companies.

The agency management and content management integration system includes testing mechanisms and performs logging to aid implementers in troubleshooting connection problems to the agency management system and the content management system . A testing platform is also provided for verifying that the mappings are configured per insurance company specifications as well as a hierarchical view of mapping results. This provides an implementer of the content management integration system an easy way to verify the view of the content structures that will be created before actually creating the structures in the content management system .

Front end processes include software elements that the end user directly interacts with to perform work. Primarily this includes providing a user interface or user interface elements within the agency management system . The user interface has icons buttons or other selectable user interface elements that a user clicks on presses or otherwise selects within the agency management system while viewing a particular domain entity. These selections perform actions such as opening linking and indexing data structures and content in the content management system .

Back end processes and utilities include software elements that may be automated and may run as services. The structure creation element creates structures in the content management system and the data synchronization element synchronizes data in the content management system to match entities in the agency management system . The various synchronization processes of the data synchronization element take the entities in the agency management system as input and generates corresponding structures in the content management system using the structure creation element based on mappings defined by the user.

There are two synchronization processes the baseline synchronization process and the delta synchronization process . The baseline synchronization process is responsible for initial structure creation and en masse structure updates in the content management system . In one embodiment the baseline synchronization process is manually started and runs and finishes completely. The delta synchronization process performs continuous content structure creation and updating. In one embodiment the delta synchronization process runs at all times as a service and uses one of two strategies to receive changes in the agency management system. For example the delta synchronization process either polls the agency management system for changes or receives notifications from the agency management system that a change has occurred and then updates the content management system accordingly. There are various configuration points and configuration utilities that allow an implementer of the agency management and content management integration system to configure and manage configurations and the operation of the various utilities. Also some of these utilities configure the front end processes .

In the content management system the entity is represented by either a file or or a folder . Entities that are represented by a file or are called top level entities such as clients and vendors of an insurance agency . Some entities are hierarchically related to other entities. In an insurance agency example clients own policies and policies have claims submitted against them. In the content management system the sub entities are represented by folders or in the file or e.g. policy or claim folders in client files or folders in another folder e.g. claim folders in policy folders . Also parent folders can be configured for these sub folders based on other criteria e.g. a claims folder to hold all claim folders or a policy term folder that holds all policies of a specific year .

Top level entities e.g. domain entity may or may not have multiple content structures e.g. files or and folders and that match them. This duplication results from the way entities are mapped into the content management system . Insurance industry business rules often divide up the work that is done on a client based on specific usage criteria of the work being done. For example a client that belongs to a certain division of a company may in some cases only be worked on by that division. A client with a policy of a certain type may in some cases only be worked on by a specific group in that company. Because of the content management system s ability to provide security features based on content structure to match the agency s work structure it is often advantageous place a client in different file containers. All files within a file container are unique but uniqueness is not required between file containers. For example in the ImageRight content management system these file containers are specified by three content structure concepts location drawer and file type. A file is considered unique based on its file number within a container . Work for one client may be split across the organization which may be referred to herein as a work division in which case it is beneficial to the organization to have a separate file container for each work division.

Also some content management system content structures may require additional originations of content within that entity s structure. For example a policy may have endorsement content or application content. By allowing the precreation of these sub structures the agency management and content management integration system allows the organization to enforce a consistent organizational scheme throughout the system removing the burden from the end user.

Shown on the user interface is example integration job information for the commercial lines policy work division associated entity filters for the integration job and an associated content structure for the integration job . Also shown are user interface controls for executing the applicable integration job .

Referring now to a filter examines information on the domain entity for example for clients it may look at the line of business for the client and accepts or rejects the entity based on that criteria. If an entity passes the all criteria setup by the filters indicated by the dashed Yes arrow then direct data mappings are applied to the entity using the entity identifier to determine the final content management structure.

If an entity passes the all criteria setup by the filters indicated by the dashed Yes arrow then custom data mapping component may be applied to the entity using other entity information to further determine the final content management structure. For files the unique entity identifier is directly mapped to an associated file number . For all entity files and entity folders the unique entity identifier is directly mapped to one specified key attribute on the file or folder. Also additional entity information may be mapped to an additional attribute resulting from the output of the custom data mapping component . In one embodiment the filters are configured to ensure that there is only one integration job per work division so that files are not duplicated within a work division.

Some entities are hierarchically related to other entities. For example clients own policies and policies have claims submitted against them. In the content management system these sub entities are represented by folders in the file. Files can contain folders and folders can contain further folders. In one embodiment the system only has one folder representing a sub entity across the entire content management system. This is enforced through proper creation of integration jobs.

In one embodiment the back end processes automatically perform these jobs whenever a change is detected in the agency management system and the front end processes allow a user to access the entity file or folder from the agency management system object after the integration job has been executed.

In one embodiment there are integrations between AMS360 Sagitta and the BenefitPoint BP agency management systems and the content management system supported is ImageRight IR .

The agency management and content management integration system enables a user to perform content management system actions from the agency management system . Shown in is a screen shot of an example user interface for performing content management system actions from an agency management system . In particular shown is a screenshot of a user interface of the AMS360 agency management system as modified and customized according to the embodiments described herein. For example Integration points have been built into this program in the form of buttons labeled WorkSmart File Open and WorkSmart File Save . Pressing the buttons within the agency management system interface initiates integration of the agency management and content management as described below.

Selecting the applicable button within the agency management system user front end calls the LaunchXX.exe program with a specific command line. The command line contains information that identifies and describes the current domain entity in this case an AMS360 client. A client called a customer in the AMS360 system and an account in BenefitPoint system is identified by some unique string in each system called the client. For AMS360 the client identifier is a globally unique identifier GUID . Also the different LaunchXX.exe programs each represent an action Open Save Accounting Management . The command line is reformatted by the LaunchXX.exe program based on the contents of the LaunchXX.ini file and based on the intended action. This reformatting results in a command line for one of the various linker programs denoted collectively as Linker.exe e.g. AMS360Link.exe for the AMS360 system SagittaLink.exe for the Sagitta system and BPLink.exe for the BenefitPoint system . After this reformatting the command line is then executed.

The Linker.exe programs e.g. AMS360Linker.exe SagittaLinker.exe and BPLinker.exe have agency management system specific knowledge and are configured to match the integration jobs defined for the integrated environment. The configurations are placed in a configuration file denoted as Link.config file that is shared between all users in the environment by placing it on a network share. On the users system only the linker.exe.config file needs to be altered to point to this shared Link.config file . This allows all users configurations to be updated by changing just one file. The Linker.exe program maps the entity identification and information to the content management system and calls the content management systems exposed interoperability interface denoted as IRLinker.exe to perform the desired command on the resulting content structure or structures that will be reflected on the content management and workflow system user front end .

The specific actions enabled by the agency management and content management integration system are Open Save and Account Management. Performing an Open action on a top level entity will cause the content management system to navigate to structures matching the entity based on the key attributes placed on the structure by the back end integration process . It will also attempt to create the appropriate file in the content management system if it does not exist filling in the key attributes at that time. Performing an Open action on a sub entity will cause the content management system to navigate to the structures matching the entity . If no matching structures are found nothing will be created.

Performing the Save action on an entity will have a content management system context specific result. is flow diagram illustrating a process of a save action performed in the agency management and content management integration system .

The process starts at the Save action such as when the user clicks the WorkSmart File Save button shown in initiating the Save action . The process will result in either tagging content structures at or indexing the selected content structures at to an existing file.

At a processor determines whether the entity to which the Save action pertains is a top level entity.

At if it was determined that the entity to which the Save action pertains is a top level entity then the processor determines whether the workflow task is locked for that entity.

At if it was determined that the workflow task is locked for that entity then the processor determines whether the current file to be saved is marked as temporary.

At if it was determined that the current file to be saved is marked as temporary then the processor indexes the selected content structures to an appropriate existing file.

At if it was determined that the entity to which the Save action pertains is not a top level entity or that the workflow task not locked for that entity or that the current file to be saved is not marked as temporary then the processor tags the selected content structures. The tagging action marks the content management structure with the key attributes of the domain entity . This tagging works on both top level entities and sub entities. This allows the Open action to use the key attributes to find the content management structure. On the other hand the indexing action only works on top level entities and moves the selected content into the correct top level content structure matching the entity based on key attributes. The original top level structure is marked as temporary and a workflow task should be locked on some structure in the original top level structure or the Save action will perform the tag option instead of the indexing action as illustrated process .

The Agency management and content management integration system pre creates content management system structures based on the agency management systems entities in an automated fashion. are screen shots of example user interfaces of the initial creation piece of the system for agency management and content management integration for creation of the content management system structures based on an agency management system s entities according to one illustrated embodiment.

The agency management and content management integration system provides a set of utilities to help pre create data structures so that users do not have to manually enter data into the content management system . Shown on user interfaces and is a connections tab under which agency management system connections are displayed. Based on these agency management system connections content management system structures will be created in response to a user interacting with the user selectable controls shown on user interface or by subscribing to a synchronization service shown in interface .

Often an agency has insurance data before implementing the agency management and content management integration system . The agency management and content management integration system provides a way to create the vast amount of structure for all of an agency s data. The baseline synchronization process executed by one or more processors performs this function. The baseline synchronization process provides on a large scale the ability to take information from an existing agency management system and apply it to the content management system .

Also once the user has run the baseline synchronization process the user will start to change their agency management system data. In order to keep the content management system synchronized with the agency management system changes in the agency management system are constantly or nearly constantly reflected in content management system . The delta synchronization process performs this function.

At the agency management and content management integration system determines which entity needs to be created or updated.

At the agency management and content management integration system retrieves the entity information e.g. from the agency management system .

At the agency management and content management integration system determines which integration jobs match the retrieved entity e.g. integration job .

At the agency management and content management integration system transforms or maps the entity into a content management structure e.g. a content management system structure such as file container and the related substructures .

At the agency management and content management integration system creates or updates the content management structure accordingly to synchronize data between the content management system and agency management system .

First will be described components common to both the update delta synchronization system architecture and a baseline synchronization system architecture of the backend integration module. There are three layers to the backend integration module. The first layer is the domain layer where the backend integration module retrieves source data from some source such as the agency management system . However the source may vary depending on the integration piece. After forming a connection to this source a data extractor creates a generic data representation for the entity and is referred to as domain objects .

These domain objects are passed to the domain transformation and mapping layer . The domain transformation and mapping layer converts domain objects into content management system domain objects which are structures like locations drawers files and folders based on integration jobs. Finally these content management system domain objects are passed to the file services layer of the content management system . This file services layer takes the representations of the content management system domain objects and actually applies changes therein to the content management system . This layered system allows for changes in either the agency management system or content management system to not affect large portions of the system.

The data extractor contains the entities that might need to be created or updated. If a sub entity is included its parent entity is included also so that the integration jobs can correctly process it. The data extractor can be made to connect to any agency system and in various ways.

For the baseline synchronization architecture the agency management and content management integration system uses extracted files from the Agency Management System Extractor containing the information for all or a subset of entities in the agency management system . From these files the latency of web service calls and database queries is avoided. Because of the large amount of data that may need to be initialized or updated these latencies can render the baseline synchronization process unusable as millions of entities each add a few seconds of latency. For example in the AMS360 management system the baseline synchronization process uses comma separated value CSV files containing entity data per line. For the Sagitta agency management system the baseline synchronization process uses XML files containing a hierarchy of data. However any file format may be used for integration of other types of systems that is capable of presenting data in an organized fashion.

For the delta synchronization architecture the connection is a web service exposed by the agency management system denoted by the notification services block in the agency management system . In order to know when a change has happened the agency management and content management integration system either polls the agency management system on a periodic or nonperiodic i.e. aperiodic basis or is notified by the agency management system through the notification services whenever a change occurs. This is controlled by the notification manager and the push pull delta event manager in the domain layer . For example in the AMS360 agency management system a delta event manager exposes a notification port that is a web service from the notification services that the agency management system can call to report changes. For the Sagitta agency management system the Web service is polled at intervals to determine the changes. From this information the entities are determined and domain objects are created for the entities. The agency management and content management integration system may include one or both of the capabilities to poll the agency management system or be notified by the agency management system through the notification services to determine the changes. The domain objects contain an identifier and all additional data that the user may want mapped to the content management system .

The agency integration processor of the domain transformation and mapping layer takes the domain objects and turns them into content management system domain objects based on the user defined integration jobs. There is often data relationally related to the data received in the domain object that needs to be mapped to the content management system . For example a customer service representative has a first and last name. The entity may represent the customer service representative as a code for example CSR52 or circle around . In the content management system one may want to see John Smith . To do this the agency management and content management integration system connects to the agency management system gathers the related data and when an entity is encountered that has a mapping to this secondary data the agency management and content management integration system looks up the value as configured by the job and substitutes it.

The content management system file services layer takes those content management domain objects and creates or updates the actual content structures by connecting into the content management system and making changes. This separation allows the file services layer to be replaced with a user interface UI element as shown in that can accept and preview the changes as in the preview area in the UI element . This is used for running sample baseline synchronizations and testing individual customers.
