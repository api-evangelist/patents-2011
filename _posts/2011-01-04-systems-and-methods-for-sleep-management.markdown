The present application claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 61 292 103 filed Jan. 4 2010 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure relates generally to the field of consumer electronic devices and in particular to systems and methods in support of enhanced consumer electronic devices for sleep management.

Alarm clocks have traditionally been used as a primary means for sleep management. These devices usually provide limited alarm settings options including what sounds are played when the alarm is triggered. In traditional alarm clocks sound options are usually limited to an alarm a radio or an audio CD. The user typically has the ability to manually preselect which type of sound is played and sometimes has the option of first playing one type of sound then playing another type of sound after a predetermined time period. The user can also preselect the radio station or CD that is to be played. In the case of a radio station the user may preselect a radio station that plays a certain type of audio content such as a light jazz radio station or the like. However the recent proliferation of consumer electronic and computing devices having various software applications and extensive interoperability has significantly expanded user s sleep management options. For example a consumer electronic device may be configured to function as an alarm clock. The device may also be connected to the traditional alarm clock and be used by the user to configure alarm settings and to select audio content to be reproduced on the alarm clock.

In addition various consumer electronic and computing devices have frequent if not constant network connectivity. These devices are capable of receiving a vast amount of information from remote data servers through the Internet. For example it is common for users of capable devices to receive traffic and or weather updates for a specific location. In many instances various elements within this received information result in additional considerations for a user. For instance if a weather forecast predicts inclement weather and or a traffic report indicates delays on a certain road a user may wish to account for these current future events by waking up at a time other than that which he she is otherwise accustomed. However there is presently no system or method that enables such accounting and or considerations to be effectively implemented.

Technologies are presented herein for a system and method for enhancing a sleep management application.

In accordance with a broad aspect of the invention a computing device executes code that implements a sleep management application which can in certain implementations provide control over a peripheral device and more particularly control that executes either a user s settings or settings that are received dynamically from an external source that may transform or otherwise alter the user s or the device s settings. As such changes in local weather or traffic can influence the settings in the peripheral device and so can changes based on other information received from a remote source all according to the operation of the sleep management application. As a result for example an alarm function of a peripheral device or the computing device itself can be adjusted even while the user sleeps to account for such changes.

According to one aspect the sleep management application cooperates with a computing device having a processor and a storage medium. The sleep management application utilizes one or more software modules that are stored on the storage medium and executed in the processor. The sleep management application operates by establishing a communications link with a server that maintains data pertaining to the computing device or to a user. The sleep management application retrieves data from the remote server and generates a custom tailored interface based on the data in order to configure a feature of the computing device. Then the sleep management application is programmed with a sleep management setting using the custom tailored interface to implement the feature so configured.

According to another aspect a computer implemented method for enhancing a sleep management application operating on a computing device and having an alarm function is provided. The computing device has a processor and a storage medium and the sleep management application has one or more software modules stored on the storage medium and executed in the processor. A communications link between the sleep management application and a remote server is initiated the remote server having external data pertaining to the computing device or to a user. The sleep management application receives the external data from the remote server and analyzes the external data to identify elements that pertain to the sleep management application. Then the sleep management application generates a control signal based on the identified elements and modifies a setting governing an operation of the alarm function of the computing device in accordance with the control signal.

According to yet another aspect a computer implemented method for enhancing a sleep management application operating on a computing device is provided. The computing device has a processor and a storage medium and the sleep management application has one or more software modules stored on the storage medium and executed upon the processor to cooperate therewith and implement enhanced sleep management functionality. The sleep management application collects data that is perceptible to or usable by the computing device and analyzes the data to identify elements that pertain to the sleep management application. The sleep management application then generates a control signal based on the identified elements and modifies the operation of the sleep management application in accordance with the control signal.

According to yet another aspect a sleep management system is provided including a processor a storage medium accessible by the processor and one or more software modules encoded on the storage medium which execute in the processor and which when executed by the processor cause the sleep management system to initiate a communications link with a remote server the remote server having external data pertaining to a computing device or to a user. The software modules in cooperation with the processor further cause the sleep management system to receive the external data from the remote server and analyze the external data to identify elements that pertain to the sleep management application. Then the software modules cause the sleep management system to generate a control signal based on the identified elements and modify a setting governing an operation of an alarm function in accordance with the control signal.

Example embodiments are described herein in the context of systems methods and computer program products for sleep management. Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the following description is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other embodiments will readily suggest themselves to such skilled persons having the benefit of this disclosure. Reference will now be made in detail to implementations of the example embodiments as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

The system further includes a sleep management application which may reside on the consumer electronic device and or on the personal computer . In general the sleep management application includes one or more software modules that provide configuration and storage of various sleep management settings for the peripheral device including but not limited to clock settings alarm settings radio settings audio settings network settings user profile settings and various other configuration parameters and settings. The sleep management application may be provided by the manufacturer of the peripheral device the manufacturer of the computing device or a third party. In one example embodiment the sleep management application may be written and distributed by the manufacturer of the peripheral device such as the manufacturer of an alarm clock radio. In another example the manufacturer of the audio reproduction device may provide Application Programming Interfaces APIs to the peripheral devices so that third party software developers can create their own sleep management applications using the provided APIs. The application may be executed by the operating system OS or the Internet browser of the consumer electronic device and or personal computer . The sleep management application may be written using C C Perl Java Visual Basic XML HTML and other known programming languages.

The system may further include various local and remote servers that operate in conjunction with the sleep management application to provide various information and services to the sleep management application consumer electronic device personal computer peripheral device and or application users. In one example embodiment the system may include a remote server hosted by the manufacturer of the peripheral device or a third party. In one embodiment server may maintain and provide to the sleep management application information about various peripheral devices which may be stored in a database and serve as a backup for the user account information which may be stored in a database . In another example embodiment the peripheral device may be located in a hotel in which case the system may include a local hotel server and hotel database . The sleep management application may communicate with the hotel server via network to provide and or receive information about various hotel services. In yet another example embodiment the system may include various social networking and or messaging servers . The sleep management application may provide and or receive status update notifications about activities of the application user or other users to from the social networking servers such as Twitter or Facebook or send email or instant messages with the user activity information using messaging servers . Operation of these and other servers will be described in greater detail herein below.

In an alternate arrangement sleep management application can be configured to receive information from one or more servers and to further utilize the received information to enhance and or modify the operation of the sleep management application including an alarm function. By way of example sleep management application can utilize the computing device s existing Internet connection to initiate a connection between the sleep management application and one or more local or remote servers . The sleep management application can then receive external data i.e. data that is present on the server but not on the computing device from the server s . Preferably the data received from the server s pertains to the computing device such as data relating to the computing device s location the user such as personal scheduling information and or personal favorites interests and or the sleep management application though in principle the sleep management application can receive any form of data. By way of example in one arrangement the sleep management application receives traffic and or weather data from one or more traffic weather related websites servers. This data can then be used to generate control signals that configure and control various settings and functions of the sleep management application in a manner that transforms or changes user device settings i.e. existing values that are set in the device that may have been input manually by the user through the sleep management application interface the computing device and or the audio reproduction device as will be described in greater detail below. Additionally the data can be received in response to a specific query by the sleep management application and or the computing device such as a query regarding current traffic conditions in a specific area and or in response to a standing query such as weather in the user s hometown .

It should be noted that while the foregoing description of an arrangement of sleep management system incorporates numerous components in other arrangements fewer or additional components can be present. Thus for example in one particular arrangement a computing device can communicate with and receive data from various external servers through network free of communication with or reliance upon the peripheral device . In such an arrangement a speaker on board the device can be the output device that provides an alert to the user as the alarm function.

As indicated above the sleep management application enables configuration of various sleep management settings and functions such as clock settings alarm settings and functions radio settings audio settings network settings user profile settings and various other configuration parameters and settings and storage of configuration settings for various peripheral devices and computing devices . To that end the sleep management application maintains a user account database that contains one or more accounts for various users of the application that contain information pertaining to the user the computing device the sleep management application and or the peripheral device . illustrates one example embodiment of a user account database containing user accounts . Each account may include user identifying information including a user s name as well as application login name and password. The account may also include user preferences including e mail address personal web site social network information such as login name and password user preferences with respect to alerts and advertisements as well as a user s buddy list. The user account may also include user activity information including current location current activity such as sleeping awake listening to radio etc. and planned activity such as waking up at 7 30 AM etc. for example. As will be described in greater detail below the sleep management application can analyze user activity information in order to generate one or more control signals that can modify the operation of the computing device the sleep management application and or the peripheral device . The account may also include user personal data including audio video files that may be reproduced on the peripheral device or on the computing device itself. The account may also include one or more user sleep profiles which include data structures containing specific sleep management scenarios for various computing devices and or peripheral devices . User sleep profiles will be discussed in greater detail herein below. The account may also include application version information and information about computing devices and or peripheral devices with which the sleep management application is configured to operate.

As noted above sleep profiles contain specific sleep management scenarios for various computing devices and or peripheral devices . These sleep profiles can also be analyzed by the sleep management application in order to generate one or more control signals that can modify the operation of the computing device the sleep management application and or the peripheral device as will be described in greater detail below. In one example a user may create sleep profiles for different days of the week thus for example a weekday may have one sleep profile and a weekend may have a different sleep profile. In addition the user may create different sleep profiles for different locations thus for example the user may have one sleep profile at home and a different sleep profile when traveling on business. Moreover sleep profiles may differ based on the functionality of the computing devices and or the peripheral device with which the sleep management application is operating. For example if device has a radio tuner a sleep profile may indicate radio stations to which the device must tune to. If the device does not have a radio tuner the sleep profile would indicate another audio source such as a CD track MP3 file or a network address to be used by the device . By way of further example if device has video display means such as an LCD screen a sleep profile can indicate i.e. identify images or videos to be displayed by the device. The sleep profiles can be easily created and stored by the user on the application . When the consumer electronic device or personal computer on which the application runs is connected to the peripheral device the user may launch the sleep management application and select a sleep profile to be executed by the application. Alternatively the application may automatically select and execute a profile that suits user preferences. In like manner by way of example the sleep profiles can indicate how the computing devices are to respond in the absence of a connection with a peripheral device .

In one example embodiment the user account database or a back up thereof may be stored on the remote server in a database . In addition the remote server may include a database of peripheral devices and or computing devices . illustrates one example embodiment of the peripheral device database . The database includes records for each manufactured peripheral device and or computing device . A record includes device model identifier device configuration data device user manual in electronic format device software update information and various APIs that allow sleep management applications to communicate with the peripheral devices and or the computing devices . The sleep management application may request device specific information from the database in order to communicate with various peripheral devices and or computing devices . In one example embodiment a part of the information of the database may be maintained by the sleep management application .

The sleep management application also includes software modules that enable the application to adjust or modify one or more settings and or configurations associated with the computing device the peripheral device and or the sleep management application as illustrated in . In one exemplary arrangement at step the sleep management application initiates and establishes a communications link with one or more server s . Preferably the server s maintain data pertaining to the computing device a peripheral device and or the user user account. At step the sleep management application then receives external data that is data that is presently external to the sleep management application and or the computing device from the server s . In doing so the sleep management application and or the computing device can transmit a specific query such as a query regarding current traffic conditions in a specific area and or a standing query such as weather in the user s hometown to one or more of the server s . By way of example based on the user account the sleep management application can identify the computing device s present location obtained via GPS etc. as referenced above as well as the user s place of employment. As such the sleep management application can retrieve external data pertaining to these locations such as traffic and or weather conditions in the user s home and or work location. In an alternate arrangement the server s may push pertinent external data to the sleep management application and or the computing device without a prior query. In either case data is being provided from a remote source to influence the operation of the sleep management application and the computing device with which it cooperates and this arrangement results in the modification of the application s configuration at least within any limits established by the user as described below.

Upon receiving the external data the sleep management application proceeds to analyze the external data at step in order to identify elements that pertain to the sleep management application the computing device and or the user user profile. In doing so the sleep management application uses one or more software modules to parse and or analyze the received external data to further identify elements of the external data that pertain to the computing device the sleep management application and or to the user user account. By way of example the sleep management application can further analyze received local traffic weather information to determine whether traffic and or weather conditions may affect a user s commute or trip. Such determinations are made in regard to the received local traffic weather information and optionally in regard to stored data concerning the travel patterns of the user say on a weekday morning.

At step the sleep management application then generates a control signal based upon the pertinent data elements. The control signal is preferably a set of one or more instructions and or parameters that direct the operation of the computing device the peripheral device and or the sleep management application . By way of example based upon an identified data element that indicates that traffic and or weather problems are occurring or are projected to occur that will add 25 minutes to a user s daily commute a control signal can be generated that modifies the alarm settings of the sleep management application to sound an alarm 25 minutes earlier than it was originally set for. As such the data received from a remote server can dynamically transform or otherwise alter the user s or the device s settings regardless of whether the user is sleeping or not present to change any settings.

Once the control signal has been generated at step the sleep management application can modify one or more settings associated with the operation of the computing device the peripheral device and or the sleep management application in accordance with the control signal. In doing so the sleep management application implements the control signal s instructions. By way of example the sleep management application can modify an existing setting that governs the operation of the sleep management application s alarm function i.e. the alarm is presently set to ring at 7 30 AM by implementing the control signal i.e. an instruction to sound the alarm 25 minutes earlier thereby resulting in an alarm setting i.e. 7 05 AM as opposed to 7 30 AM which is tailored to the specific circumstances relevant to the user.

It should be noted that while in one arrangement the generated control signals are applied in an automated fashion that is they are applied without the need for user input and or interaction in other arrangements the user can be prompted to review and approve deny the implementation of one or more control signals. By way of example the sleep management application can display to a user a proposed control signal i.e. set alarm clock 25 minutes earlier . Alternatively the sleep management application can provide the user with the underlying information that is used by the sleep management application to derive the control signal for example the pertinent traffic weather data and enable the user to either approve or deny the implementation of the control signal. Alternatively the user can edit the parameters of the control signal for example the user can modify the control signal to have the alarm sound 15 minutes earlier as opposed to the originally proposed 25 minutes or within a limit such as no more than 15 minutes earlier than any previously set time . The user can further select which settings functions and or operations can be modified by generated control signals without user prompting and which settings functions and or operations require user acceptance prior to implementation.

It should be further noted that while the foregoing examples have illustrated the operation of the sleep management application with respect to modifying an alarm function the sleep management application can modify nearly any function setting and or operation pertaining to the computing device the peripheral device and or the sleep management application . By way of example as described in detail above using any of a variety of means the sleep management application can detect the location of the computing device . Utilizing this information together with received external information as described above the sleep management application can determine that the user is at a stadium during a sporting event. Accordingly a control signal can be generated which increases the volume of the computing device s ringer thereby enabling the user to hear audible notifications despite noisy surroundings.

In addition while the foregoing description has referred periodically to interaction and or communications between the computing device and or the peripheral device with one or more servers it should be noted that in other arrangements the sleep management application and other aspects and features disclosed herein are fully operable without communication with and or connection to such servers. In such embodiments data and or information that is received from and or sent to the server s can instead be obtained from transmitted to internal and or local memory storage accessible by computing device and or peripheral device s . Additionally various elements referenced above such as user activity information and sleep profiles can be analyzed and control signals can be generated based upon these items.
