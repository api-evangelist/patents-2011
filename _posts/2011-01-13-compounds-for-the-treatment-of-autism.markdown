The invention relates to a compound which inhibits the importation of chloride into neurons or a compound which improve the outflow of chloride from neurons for use in the treatment of autism.

Infantile Autistic Syndrome Disorders ASD include a wide range of abnormalities including a genuine incapacity to organise affective relations behavioural anomalies in reciprocal social interactions verbal and non verbal communication limited interest in the surrounding environment associated with stereotyped movements and repetitive plays Kanner 1943 Levy and Hyman 1993 Levy and Hyman 2005 Adrien et al. 2001 Blanc et al. 2005 Bourreau et al. 2009 . Research to date indicates that a genetic predisposition may play a role in the disease but one or more environmental factors must be in place for symptoms to occur including environmental contaminants and possibly maternal exposures during gestation Persico and Bourgeron 2006 Bourgeron 2009 Patterson 2002 . It is suggested that genetic and environmental hazards will alter developmental programs leading to cortical and or sub cortical malformations and the formation of misplaced misconnected neuronal ensembles. The first symptoms occur before 3 years of age with most likely an earlier origin. There is at present no efficient biological pharmaceutical treatment to ASD.

Brain maturation is associated with a developmental sequential expression of voltage gated receptor synapse driven channels and brain patterns Spitzer et al. 1994 Ben Ari et al. 2007 . The developmental shifts of the actions of the inhibitory transmitter GABA is but one example of these changes. Immature neurons have a higher Cl than adults leading to paradoxical excitatory actions of GABA Ben Ari 2002 Ben Ari et al. 2007 . This is due to an early expression of the co transporter NKCC1 that imports chloride and a late operation of KCC2 that export chloride form neurons Kahle and Staley 2008 Rivera et al. 1999 Dzhala et al. 2005 Delpire et al. 1999 Delpire 2000 Li et al. 2002 . In addition the regulation of Cl is dynamic and altered by even brief episodes of enhanced activity Balena and Woodin 2008 Fiumelli et al. 2005 Fiumelli and Woodin 2007 Woodin et al. 2003 and more persistently by a variety of insults lesions seizures and neurological disorders Khalilov et al. 2003 Khalilov et al. 2005 Cohen et al. 2002 Huberfeld et al. 2006 Huberfeld et al. 2007 . Consequently diuretic agents that reduce Cl constitute novel antiepileptic and neuro protective agents Dzhala et al. 2005 Nardou et al. 2009 Kahle et al. 2008 Payne et al. 2003 . In keeping with this clinical tests are presently being conducted to that aim in infantile epilepsies.

Bumetanide Bum Cohen 1981 Feit 1981 is a classical diuretic that selectively antagonises the co transporter NKCC1 thereby reducing Cl Delpire et al. 1999 Delpire and Mount 2002 . Bum has been extensively utilised in adults since 1975 and in children since 1986 and its pharmacokinetic in adults and children and its side effects are well known Lopez Samblas et al. 1997 Sullivan et al. 1996 Witte et al. 1986 Marshall et al. 1998 . Bum is used in acute oedema following head trauma and long term conditions including broncho pulmonary dysplasia nephritic syndromes or heart congestions O Donnell et al. 2004 Mackie et al. 1986 Sullivan et al. 1996 and has been recently reported to reduce seizure severity in a case report Kahle et al. 2009 . The use of Bum is safe provided that it is accompanied with continuous clinical and biological surveillance notably in children.

The inventors have now investigated in 5 autistic infants the effects of bum with ongoing clinical and biological surveillance. They were selected with no a priori from a large group of ASD children placed in institutions or at home to provide a variety of cases. The diuretic was administered 1 mg 24 h 0.5 mg twice a day and the treatment continued for 3 months a minimal duration considered to be sufficient for an evaluation of the effects on IAS. We report a significant improvement of the IAS manifestations in the 5 children. These observations call for wide range screening of the use of Bum in IAS and more generally in autism.

The inventors have made the hypothesis that an antagonist of the NKCC co transporter which inhibits the importation of chloride into neurons and thereby reduces intracellular concentrations may be useful for the treatment of autism.

Thus the invention relates to a compound which inhibits the importation of chloride into neurons and a compound which improve the outflow of chloride from neurons for use in the treatment of autism.

In another aspect the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of autism comprising a compound according to the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

As used herein the term autism denotes a family of disorders of neural development that is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication restricted and repetitive behaviour accompanied with other deficits. These signs all begin before a child is three years old. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood. The two other autism spectrum disorders ASD are Asperger syndrome which lacks delays in cognitive development and language atypical autism diagnosed when full criteria for the other two disorders are not met and PDD NOS when pervasive developmental disorder are not specified.

As used herein NKCC for Na K Cl co transporter denotes a protein that assists in the active transport of sodium potassium and chloride into and out of cells. There are several varieties or isoforms of this membrane transport protein notably NKCC1 and NKCC2. NKCC1 is widely distributed throughout the body but also in the brain and in particular in the developing animal and human brain. It acts to augment intracellular chloride in neurons and thereby to render GABA more excitatory. Extensive investigations indicate that blocking NKCC1 reduce intracellular chloride thereby augmenting the inhibitory actions of GABA. In vivo and in vitro studies have now indicated that genetic and or pharmacological blockade of NKCC1 reduces early network activity.

As used herein the term KCC for potassium chloride co transporter denotes a co transporter of chloride. There are several varieties or isoforms notably KCC2. KCC2 is found in many organs notably in the brain acts to remove intracellular chloride and thereby to augment the inhibitory actions of GABA. Blockers of KCC2 transform GABA to excitatory and facilitate the generation of seizures and genetic invalidation of KCC2 is lethal in mice. KCC2 is also expressed relatively late in development paralleling the shift of the actions of GABA from excitatory to inhibitory. Also a wide range of insults and seizures remove functional KCC2 thereby leading to persistent excitatory actions of GABA and further seizures.

As used herein the term diuretic denotes any drug that elevates the rate of urination and thus provides a means of forced diuresis. There are several categories of diuretics. All diuretics increase the excretion of water from bodies although each class does so in a distinct way.

As used herein the term loop diuretics denotes diuretics that act on the ascending loop of Henle in the kidney.

As used herein the term treating or treatment denotes reversing alleviating inhibiting the progress of or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies or reversing alleviating inhibiting the progress of or preventing one or more symptoms of the disorder or condition to which such term applies.

A first object of the invention relates to a compound which inhibits the importation of chloride into neurons or a compound which improve the outflow of chloride from neurons for use in the treatment of autism.

In a preferred embodiment the compound according to the invention inhibits the NKCC co transporter or activates the KCC co transporter.

In another preferred embodiment the compound according to the invention is an antagonist of NKCC co transporter or an agonist of KCC co transporter.

In one embodiment said NKCC antagonist or KCC agonist may be a low molecular weight antagonist e. g. a small organic molecule natural or not .

The term small organic molecule refers to a molecule natural or not of a size comparable to those organic molecules generally used in pharmaceuticals. The term excludes biological macromolecules e. g. proteins nucleic acids etc. . Preferred small organic molecules have a size range up to about 5000 Da more preferably up to 2000 Da and most preferably up to about 1000 Da.

In another embodiment NKCC antagonist or KCC agonist of the invention may consist in an antibody which inhibits NKCC or activates KCC or an antibody fragment which inhibits NKCC or activates KCC.

Antibodies directed against NKCC or KCC can be raised according to known methods by administering the appropriate antigen or epitope to a host animal selected e.g. from pigs cows horses rabbits goats sheep and mice among others. Various adjuvants known in the art can be used to enhance antibody production. Although antibodies useful in practicing the invention can be polyclonal monoclonal antibodies are preferred. Monoclonal antibodies against NKCC or KCC can be prepared and isolated using any technique that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. Techniques for production and isolation include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein 1975 the human B cell hybridoma technique Cote et al. 1983 and the EBV hybridoma technique Cole et al. 1985 . Alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 can be adapted to produce anti NKCC or anti KCC single chain antibodies. NKCC antagonists or KCC agonists useful in practicing the present invention also include anti NKCC antibody fragments or anti KCC antibody fragment including but not limited to F ab fragments which can be generated by pepsin digestion of an intact antibody molecule and Fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab fragments. Alternatively Fab and or scFv expression libraries can be constructed to allow rapid identification of fragments having the desired specificity to NKCC or KCC.

Humanized anti NKCC antibodies or anti KCC antibodies and antibody fragments therefrom can also be prepared according to known techniques. Humanized antibodies are forms of non human e.g. rodent chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region CDRs of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Methods for making humanized antibodies are described for example by Winter U.S. Pat. No. 5 225 539 and Boss Celltech U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 397 .

In still another embodiment NKCC antagonists or KCC agonists may be selected from aptamers. Aptamers are a class of molecule that represents an alternative to antibodies in term of molecular recognition. Aptamers are oligonucleotide or oligopeptide sequences with the capacity to recognize virtually any class of target molecules with high affinity and specificity. Such ligands may be isolated through Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment SELEX of a random sequence library as described in Tuerk C. and Gold L. 1990. The random sequence library is obtainable by combinatorial chemical synthesis of DNA. In this library each member is a linear oligomer eventually chemically modified of a unique sequence. Possible modifications uses and advantages of this class of molecules have been reviewed in Jayasena S. D. 1999. Peptide aptamers consists of a conformationally constrained antibody variable region displayed by a platform protein such as Thioredoxin A that are selected from combinatorial libraries by two hybrid methods Colas et al. 1996 .

Small inhibitory RNAs siRNAs can also function as inhibitors of NKCC co transporter gene expression for use in the present invention. NKCC co transporter gene expression can be reduced by contacting a subject or cell with a small double stranded RNA dsRNA or a vector or construct causing the production of a small double stranded RNA such that NKCC co transporter gene expression is specifically inhibited i.e. RNA interference or RNAi . Methods for selecting an appropriate dsRNA or dsRNA encoding vector are well known in the art for genes whose sequence is known e.g. see Tuschl T. et al. 1999 Elbashir S. M. et al. 2001 Hannon G J. 2002 McManus M T. et al. 2002 Brummelkamp T R. et al. 2002 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 573 099 and 6 506 559 and International Patent Publication Nos. WO 01 36646 WO 99 32619 and WO 01 68836 .

Ribozymes can also function as inhibitors of NKCC co transporter gene expression for use in the present invention. Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. The mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence specific hybridization of the ribozyme molecule to complementary target RNA followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Engineered hairpin or hammerhead motif ribozyme molecules that specifically and efficiently catalyze endonucleolytic cleavage of NKCC co transporter mRNA sequences are thereby useful within the scope of the present invention. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within any potential RNA target are initially identified by scanning the target molecule for ribozyme cleavage sites which typically include the following sequences GUA GUU and GUC. Once identified short RNA sequences of between about 15 and 20 ribonucleotides corresponding to the region of the target gene containing the cleavage site can be evaluated for predicted structural features such as secondary structure that can render the oligonucleotide sequence unsuitable. The suitability of candidate targets can also be evaluated by testing their accessibility to hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides using e.g. ribonuclease protection assays.

Both antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes useful as inhibitors of NKCC co transporter gene expression can be prepared by known methods. These include techniques for chemical synthesis such as e.g. by solid phase phosphoramadite chemical synthesis. Alternatively anti sense RNA molecules can be generated by in vitro or in vivo transcription of DNA sequences encoding the RNA molecule. Such DNA sequences can be incorporated into a wide variety of vectors that incorporate suitable RNA polymerase promoters such as the T7 or SP6 polymerase promoters. Various modifications to the oligonucleotides of the invention can be introduced as a means of increasing intracellular stability and half life. Possible modifications include but are not limited to the addition of flanking sequences of ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides to the 5 and or 3 ends of the molecule or the use of phosphorothioate or 2 O methyl rather than phosphodiesterase linkages within the oligonucleotide backbone.

Antisense oligonucleotides siRNAs and ribozymes of the invention may be delivered in vivo alone or in association with a vector. In its broadest sense a vector is any vehicle capable of facilitating the transfer of the antisense oligonucleotide siRNA or ribozyme nucleic acid to the cells and preferably cells expressing NKCC co transporter. Preferably the vector transports the nucleic acid to cells with reduced degradation relative to the extent of degradation that would result in the absence of the vector. In general the vectors useful in the invention include but are not limited to plasmids phagemids viruses other vehicles derived from viral or bacterial sources that have been manipulated by the insertion or incorporation of the the antisense oligonucleotide siRNA or ribozyme nucleic acid sequences. Viral vectors are a preferred type of vector and include but are not limited to nucleic acid sequences from the following viruses retrovirus such as moloney murine leukemia virus harvey murine sarcoma virus murine mammary tumor virus and rouse sarcoma virus adenovirus adeno associated virus SV40 type viruses polyoma viruses Epstein Barr viruses papilloma viruses herpes virus vaccinia virus polio virus and RNA virus such as a retrovirus. One can readily employ other vectors not named but known to the art.

In a preferred embodiment an analog according to the invention may have a formula as described in the patent application WO2006110187.

In a preferred embodiment the analog may be bumetanide aldehyde bumetanide dibenzylamide bumetanide diethylamide bumetanide morpholinoethyl ester bumetanide 3 dimethylaminopropyl ester bumetanide N N diethylglycolamide ester bumetanide dimethylglycolamide ester bumetanide pivaxetil ester bumetanide methoxy polyethyleneoxy n i ethyl ester  bumetanide benzyltrimethyl ammonium salt and bumetanide cetyltrimethylammonium salt.

In another preferred embodiment the analog may be furosemide aldehyde furosemide ethyl ester furosemide cyanomethyl ester furosemide benzyl ester furosemide morpholinoethyl ester furosemide 3 dimethylaminopropyl ester furosemide N N diethylglycolamide ester furosemide dibenzylamide furosemide benzyltrimethylammonium salt furosemide cetyltrimethylammonium salt furosemide N N dimethylglycolamide ester furosemide methoxy polyethyleneoxy n i ethyl ester furosemide pivaxetil ester and furosemide propaxetil ester.

In another preferred embodiment the analog may be tetrazolyl substituted azosemides such as methoxymethyl tetrazolyl substituted azosemides methylthiomethyl tetrazolyl substituted azosemides and N mPEG350 tetrazolyl substituted azosemides azosemide benzyltrimethylammonium salt and or azosemide cetyltrimethylammonium salt.

Examples include but are not limited to methoxymethyl pyridinium torsemide salts methylthiomethyl pyridinium torsemide salts and N mPEG350 pyridinium torsemide salts.

In a preferred embodiment the compound according to the invention is a compound which inhibits the level of the NKCC protein on the cell surface or improves the level of the KCC protein on the cell surface.

Another object of the invention relates to a method for treating autism comprising administering to a subject in need thereof with a compound which inhibits the importation of chloride into neurons or a compound which improve the outflow of chloride from neurons.

In one aspect the invention relates to a method for treating autism comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a NKCC antagonist as above described.

Compounds of the invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition as defined below.

Preferably said compound which inhibits the importation of chloride into neurons or which improve the outflow of chloride from neurons preferably said antagonist of NKCC or said agonist of KCC is administered in a therapeutically effective amount.

By a therapeutically effective amount is meant a sufficient amount of compound to treat and or to prevent diseases as described previously.

It will be understood that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder activity of the specific compound employed the specific composition employed the age body weight general health sex and diet of the patient the time of administration route of administration and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed the duration of the treatment drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific polypeptide employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. However the daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 0.01 to 1 000 mg per adult per day. Preferably the compositions contain 0.01 0.05 0.1 0.5 1.0 2.5 5.0 10.0 15.0 25.0 50.0 100 250 and 500 mg of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. A medicament typically contains from about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient preferably from 1 mg to about 100 mg of the active ingredient. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level from 0.0002 mg kg to about 20 mg kg of body weight per day especially from about 0.001 mg kg to 7 mg kg of body weight per day.

Compounds according to the invention may be used for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of autism.

Hence the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective dose of a compound which inhibits the NKCC co transporter preferably a NKCC antagonist or which activates the KCC co transporter according to the invention.

Any therapeutic agent of the invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and optionally sustained release matrices such as biodegradable polymers to form therapeutic compositions.

 Pharmaceutically or pharmaceutically acceptable refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to a mammal especially a human as appropriate. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient refers to a non toxic solid semi solid or liquid filler diluent encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type.

The form of the pharmaceutical compositions the route of administration the dosage and the regimen naturally depend upon the condition to be treated the severity of the illness the age weight and sex of the patient etc.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be formulated for a topical oral intranasal parenteral intraocular intravenous intramuscular or subcutaneous administration and the like.

Preferably the pharmaceutical compositions contain vehicles which are pharmaceutically acceptable for a formulation capable of being injected. These may be in particular isotonic sterile saline solutions monosodium or disodium phosphate sodium potassium calcium or magnesium chloride and the like or mixtures of such salts or dry especially freeze dried compositions which upon addition depending on the case of sterilized water or physiological saline permit the constitution of injectable solutions.

The doses used for the administration can be adapted as a function of various parameters and in particular as a function of the mode of administration used of the relevant pathology or alternatively of the desired duration of treatment.

In addition other pharmaceutically acceptable forms include e.g. tablets or other solids for oral administration time release capsules and any other form currently can be used.

Pharmaceutical composition according to the invention may also contain other compounds which may be biologically active or inactive. For example one or more treatment agents of the present invention may be combined with another agent in a treatment combination and administered according to a treatment regimen of the present invention. Such combinations may be administered as separate compositions combined for delivery in a complementary delivery system or formulated in a combined composition such as a mixture or a fusion compound. Additionally the aforementioned treatment combination may include a BBB permeability enhancer and or a hyperosmotic agent.

Alternatively compounds of the invention which inhibits the NKCC co transporter or activates the KCC co transporter can be further identified by screening methods as hereinafter described.

Another object of the invention relates to a method for screening a compound which inhibits the NKCC co transporter of activates the KCC co transporter.

In particular the invention provides a method for screening a NKCC antagonist or a KCC agonist for the treatment of autism.

For example the screening method may measure the binding of a candidate compound to NKCC or KCC or to cells or membranes bearing NKCC or KCC or a fusion protein thereof by means of a label directly or indirectly associated with the candidate compound. Alternatively a screening method may involve measuring or qualitatively or quantitatively detecting the competition of binding of a candidate compound to the receptor with a labelled competitor e.g. antagonist .

Furthermore screening methods may test whether the candidate compound results in a signal generated by an antagonist of NKCC or an agonist of KCC using detection systems appropriate to cells bearing the receptor.

c determining whether said candidate compound binds to and inhibits NKCC or binds to and activates KCC and

In one embodiment the NKCC co transporter or the KCC co transporter used in the screening method may be its orthologs and derivatives as defined in the present invention.

In general such screening methods involve providing appropriate cells which express NKCC or KCC its orthologs and derivatives thereof on their surface. In particular a nucleic acid encoding NKCC or KCC may be employed to transfect cells to thereby express the receptor of the invention. Such a transfection may be accomplished by methods well known in the art.

In a particular embodiment cells are selected from the group consisting of glial cells neuronal cells neurones transfected cell lines for investigations or renal cells of any species mouse human . . . .

The screening method of the invention may be employed for determining an antagonist or agonist by contacting such cells with compounds to be screened and determining whether such compound inhibits or activates the co transporter.

The determination of the inhibition of NKCC can be assessed by determining the cell viability. A compound is deemed to decrease cell viability if it is negative in any one the methods described below as examples of cell rescue activity.

According to a one embodiment of the invention the candidate compound of may be selected from a library of compounds previously synthesised or a library of compounds for which the structure is determined in a database or from a library of compounds that have been synthesised de novo or natural compounds.

The candidate compound may be selected from the group of a proteins or peptides b nucleic acids and c organic or chemical compounds natural or not . Illustratively libraries of pre selected candidate nucleic acids may be obtained by performing the SELEX method as described in documents U.S. Pat. No. 5 475 096 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 270 163. Further illustratively the candidate compound may be selected from the group of antibodies directed against NKCC or KCC.

The invention will be further illustrated by the following tables and examples. However these examples and figures should not be interpreted in any way as limiting the scope of the present invention.

The inventors have investigated in 5 autistic infants the effects of bum with ongoing clinical and biological surveillance. They were selected with no a priori from a large group of IAS children placed in institutions or at home to provide a variety of cases. The diuretic was administered 1 mg 24 h 0.5 mg twice a day and the treatment continued for 3 months a minimal duration considered to be sufficient for an evaluation of the effects on IAS. We report a significant improvement of the IAS manifestations in the 5 children. These observations call for wide range screening of the use of Bum in IAS.

Children were diagnosed by experienced clinical psychiatrist using strict ICD 10 OMS 1993 criteria for autistic disorder. These children had no history of neurological disease normal EEG Genetic tests systematically performed were negative indicating no identifiable mutation Caryotype and fragile X . The ADI R Le Couteur et al. 1989 Lord et al. 1994 was collected for all participants to confirm the diagnoses. A clinical and biological examinations showed that none of the infants had a counter indication to bum including blood ionogram transaminases alkaline phosphatases uremia creatinemia creatinine clearance GT glycemia notably . Since hypokalemia can induce wave burst arrhythmia an ECG was performed to ensure that none of the patients had a lengthening of the QT because they have a higher propensity to generate arrhythmia. A clinical weekly surveillance was performed during the first second and third month after treatment onset including blood sodium and potassium one week and 2 months after treatment onset. None of the infants had associated neurological disorders and none was under other treatment since at least three months.

To determine the possible therapeutic index efficacy we relied on 5 classical behavioural determination of IAS severity including 

i The Childhood Autism Rating Scale CARS is a 15 item rating scale that is used as a screening instrument and to assess the changes in symptoms of autism over time. These items comprise a broad range of symptoms of autism and are graded on a scale of 1 to 4 with 1 indicating normal behaviour and 4 denoting severely abnormal and or inappropriate behaviour. The total score is determined by adding the 15 items. The number of items with a scale equal or superior to 3 is a strong indication of syndrome severity whereas a fall in either the total score after treatment and or of the number of items equal or above 3 indicates improvement in the severity of autistic features Rogers et al. 1993 . This instrument was developed to aid the diagnostic process but is also sensitive to developmental changes in autistic symptoms Schopler et al. 1980 Mesibov et al. 1989 and can be used to determine alterations produced by a treatment Di Lalla and Rogers 1994 also see the French version of B. Rog 1989 . The notation was obtained during a session when the infants were placed in a game and animated discussion with the parents concerning the behaviour of the child during the last week.

ii The ABC Aberrant Behaviour Checklist is a questionnaire filled by the treating doctor during a discussion with the parents Aman et al. 1985 Rojahn and Helsel 1991 . It is widely used in therapeutic trials to evaluate the impact of molecules on behaviour. ABC is a 58 item standardized problem with behaviour checklist that allows item rating on a 4 point scale from 0 not occurring at all to 3 severe . The checklist questions comprise 5 subscales Irritability ABC1 Social Withdrawal ABC2 Stereotypy ABC3 Hyperactivity ABC4 and Excessive Speech ABCS . ABC has been validated on a large scale in the US and is adapted to studies of infantile populations. A French version has been used in the present study Bouvard 2000 .

iii The Clinical Global Impressions CGI is widely used in the majority of clinical trials to examine disease severity. It is scaled from 0 to 7 with 1 being the normal value and it is considered a good estimation of the global situation of the patient. The clinician is asked to give a quotation of the disease as a function of his her experience with other patients included in the investigation. The second impression provides an estimation of the global improvement of the patient and amelioration when compared to the onset of the trail. There are 7 levels zero indicating no evolution. The third impression is the most useful as it concerns the therapeutic index and requires a single estimation that indicate both the therapeutic and side effects. This is utilised in research on novel generation psychotic agents with little side effects Guy 1976 .

iv RDEG the regulation disorder Evaluation grid is a French scale of activity 96 that enables to detect the level of dys regulation and the slowness of response of the infants Adrien 1996 Adrien et al. 2001 Blanc et al. 2005 . The questionnaire is filled by the parents and concerns the behaviour of the children during the last week.

v The Repetitive and Restricted Behaviour RRB scale Bourreau et al 2009 is a 35 item standardized checklist that allows item rating on a 5 point scale from 0 the behaviour is never expressed by the person to 4 the behaviour is severely expressed and characteristic of the person . Factorial analysis produces four clinical meaningful factors i.e. sensori motor stereotypes F 1 reaction to change F2 restricted behaviours F3 and modulation insufficiency F4 .

A summary of the patients is shown in Table 1. 3 boys used a functional language whereas the remaining boy and girl did not. The scores of ADI R are above the threshold confirming the clinical diagnosis. Childs 1 3 5 follow a traditional school accompanied by an auxiliary person. During the year child 1 and child 2 are followed by a psychologist using the ABA approach once a week for child 1 and 3 times a week for child 2 . Child 2 has also 2 weekly session of orthophony relying on picture exchange communication system PECS . Child 3 has an orthophonic treatment weekly and child 5 has no treatment. Child 4 is treated in a medical institution specialised in mentally retarded children. The test of bum was made during the summer vacation when behavioural therapy and school were interrupted.

Table 2 shows the scores of the different scales used and those obtained before and after three months treatment. Before the treatment 4 children 1 2 3 4 had a CARS score above 36 indicating a severe IAS. Child 5 showed a medium degree of autism. Results show an improvement of the total scores of CARS ABC RDEG and RRB for all children three months after the treatment. CGI1 was not significantly altered but this test concerns the severity of the disease that at this stage does not reveal significant changes. We also observed a small global amelioration of CGI2 for the 5 children. Patients 1 2 and 5 had an index of 3 in CGI3 indicating a moderate action with no side effects. Patients 3 and 4 had an index of 2 indicating a minimal action with no side effects. The number of items equal or above 3 with CARS was reduced by the treatment in the five children. The sub score of ABC5 was not altered by the treatment. In the five children ABC2 ABC3 ABC4 RDEG dysregulation RDEG slowness RRBF4 RRB F1 were ameliorated to a variable degree. In contrast the results of ABC1 RRB F2 RRB F3 are heterogeneous.

Starting one week after the treatment and once monthly a clinical surveillance was made including research of deshydratation orthostatic hypotension hyper senstivity cramps asthenia diarrheas myalgia arthralgia nausea dizziness. The levels of sodium and potassium remained stable tests made a week and 2 months after the beginning of the treatment. No adverse effect was found.

Present results suggest that bumetanide ameliorates behavioural aspects of IAS suggesting that the diuretic has a global action. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report raising the possibility of chloride alterations in autism.

The conclusions derived form these observations are hampered by several limitations including the lack of randomized double blind and placebo investigations due to the limited number of cases. Placebo effects are more prevalent in children than adults Rheims et al. 2008 this also applies to autism Sandler 2005 . Clearly wide scale investigations are needed to confirm or infirm the observations. We are aware of these limitations to demonstrate the positive effects of bumetanide and entangle its actions on IAS. Nevertheless our observations indicate that bumetanide has no side effects with a general tolerance to the diuretic. Also we were encouraged to present these observations by the dramatic behavioural amelioration suggested by the results and the insistence of the parents that their children are more present and their wish to pursue the treatment speaking in favour of a significant action of bum. In spite of the difficulty in translating this subjective notion it is interesting to stress that the same term of presence was used by all parents.

It is not possible at present to determine whether bumetanide exerts a preferential action on one aspect of the symptomatology. The lack of effects of bumetanide on ABC5 inappropriate excessive speech out of context is expected because amelioration in 3 months of speech is unlikely to occur. In contrast almost all scores were ameliorated to variable degrees stressing the general action of bumetanide. Alteration of cognitive and emotional behaviour is a basic feature of IAS Kanner 1943 Hill and Frith 2003 Hill 2004 Bieberich and Morgan 2004 and the fact that bumetanide enables a better cognitive regulation is perhaps to be correlated with the improved presence reported by the parents. The results of the subscales of ABC suggest an amelioration of states of vigilance and social interactions stereotypic movements and hyperactivity again in keeping with the notion of cognitive regulation. The pharmaco dynamic of bumetanide has been investigated in human neonates Sullivan et al. 1996 Lopez Samblas et al. 1997 and a recent report suggests that bumetanide reduces seizure severity in an epileptic child Kahle et al. 2009 . A wide range of experimental investigations suggest that bumetanide reduces seizure severity Kahle and Staley 2008 Kahle et al. 2008 Nardou et al. 2009 . Bumetanide is currently being investigated as a novel treatment for neonatal seizures EU FP7 Nemo project .

The observations are compatible with the working hypothesis that bumetanide enhances the efficacy of neuronal integrative processes by reducing intracellular chloride and reinforcing the inhibitory actions of GABA. The basic conceptual frame of these investigations is that neurons who fail to respect the developmental program keep immature features including possibly high Cl I and other electrical and architectural properties Ben Ari 2008 . Other observations suggest a link between GABAergic signals and autism Minshew 1997 Hussman 2001 Schmitz et al. 2005 . Also several brain imaging observations indicate a significant loss of GABA benzodiazepines receptors in autism notably in the hippocampus cerebellum and various limbic structures Garreau et al. 1993 Oblak et al. 2009 Guptill et al. 2007 Blatt 2005 .

In conclusion an emerging series of studies suggest that chloride accumulates during brain maturation in relation to various developmental malformations. Present observations suggest that a conventional diuretic that reduces this accumulation and acts to reinstate the inhibitory actions of GABA. may exert beneficial actions in autism calling for more detailed experimental and clinical studies on the links between GABA Cl I and IAS.
