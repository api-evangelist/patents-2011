The present invention relates to an electrical contactor with touch control which is intended more particularly but not exclusively for controlling the electromagnetic valve of a tap.

The problem which has been posed consists in producing a contactor the manufacture of which can be rationalised and which when in use is well protected against acts of vandalism.

The principle of operation of a contactor of this kind consists in applying a light pressure to a surface which pressure is transmitted to a piezoelectric pellet which delivers a signal the latter then being processed via an electronic circuit so as to obtain a predetermined control signal.

The components required for producing the electronic circuit are fixed to the face of a card which is made of an insulating material and against the other face of which the piezoelectric pellet is applied.

While the incorporation of the pellet in the electronic card poses no problem the same does not apply as regards the production of the link between the face of the card comprising the pellet and the protective partition.

In the prior art this link is produced by means of a double sided adhesive. The card is applied under pressure against the protective partition and the pressure is maintained for a certain length of time in order for the bonding to become effective. Apart from the fact that it is awkward because of the presence of the electronic components this procedure requires a certain length of time and this stoppage in the process for manufacturing the contactor is not acceptable from the viewpoint of an industrial manufacturing operation.

The contactor belonging to the invention is notable in that it comprises a metal casing of which the bottom which is thinned down constitutes the partition behind which is arranged the electronic card which is kept applied against the partition by a tubular member of which one end which is elastically deformable is applied against the periphery of the said card the said casing and the said card comprising means which together bring about the holding of the said member in position.

Referring to the drawings and according to one mode of embodiment and especially to it can be seen that the contactor comprises three parts and .

The part is formed by a metal casing comprising a lateral jacket and a bottom which is sufficiently thin to be deformed under the effect of a light manual pressure.

The part is constituted by a board referred to below as a card which is made of an insulating material and comprises electronic components not represented on its face and a piezoelectric pellet not represented on its face which is normally applied against the internal face of the bottom according to a known process.

It should be noted that the electric cables for supplying the electronic circuit and for emission of the control signal have not been represented but are appropriately connected to the electronic circuit belonging to the face

The part which constitutes the tubular member for holding the card in position assumes the shape of a circular ring and is made of an elastically deformable plastic material.

The end of the ring which is normally in contact with the card is shaped so as to allow slight flattening under the effect of an axial thrust and to exert a compressive pre stress on the said card.

The external diameter of the ring is smaller than the internal diameter of the part of the casing. However the ring has at least one lug which extends beyond the diameter of the said ring the lug extending substantially obliquely in relation to the axis of the ring in such a way that the distance that separates a point on the periphery of the said lug and the said axis increases from that end of the ring which is in contact with the card to the other end.

In this way when the ring is fitted into the casing the lug flexes elastically until the moment at which it is able to ease into a slot provided in the part of the said casing. In this position the end of the lug rests against the edge of the slot and resists axial displacement of the ring and consequently axial displacement of the card which is applied and held in position without any play against the internal face of the bottom .

As is apparent from the drawings the ring has two pairs of lugs arranged symmetrically in relation to a diametral plane line at XY in and the casing therefore comprises four corresponding slots.

According to one feature of the invention the card assumes the shape of a regular octagon. It makes it possible to industrialise the manufacture of the circuits and especially to facilitate the cutting out of the cards which are initially produced on a single board comprising a plurality of identical circuits.

In order to ensure satisfactory contact between the end of the ring and the periphery of the octagonal board notches are made on the end of the said ring delimiting portions which each rest against the corresponding part of the board for example a against a see .

The ring is completed by a bar comprising two slots with a T shaped section which are used to guide the electric cables. The bar extends in a direction perpendicular to the axis XY. This arrangement constitutes an advantageous visual reference point when clipping in the ring after the manner of an error preventing device.

As regards error prevention it should be pointed out that the card has at its periphery at least one notch which is capable of cooperating with a finger on the casing in order to position the said card and consequently the electric cables.

According to one mode of embodiment the casing has at its periphery a shoulder which is capable of cooperating in the fixing of the contactor in a body C as shown in flanges such as are suggested at B in the said Figure perform the holding function and each flange may be constituted by an ordinary screw the head of which rests under the lower edge of the said casing.

The casing which has just been described is obtained by injection and that is the reason for the shape and arrangement of the slots . If this casing is obtained by machining it is advantageous to replace the slots by a groove as shown in .

The elasticity of the ring and that of the layer of adhesive material interposed between the bottom of the casing and the corresponding face is sufficient to maintain contact without any play. The geometry dimensions and material of the ring are defined in such a way that the value of the pre stress exerted by said ring on the card remains within the values defined while gaining freedom from the dimensional tolerances inherent in the manufacture of the various pieces.

In the course of time however the materials may lose their properties which is why the invention makes provision when the three parts are assembled as shown in for the face of the card to be covered with a dual component polyurethane resin which permits cold setting for example and which on hardening insulates the electronic circuit from moisture and holds the said card in position independently of the action of the clips ring .
