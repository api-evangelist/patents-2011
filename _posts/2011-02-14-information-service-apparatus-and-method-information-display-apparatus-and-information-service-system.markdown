No. 7 925 497 and which claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2003 001115 filed Jan. 7 2003 the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention generally relates to information service apparatuses and more particularly to an information service apparatus that provides information to a terminal connected to the information service apparatus through a network.

There are image processing apparatuses that serve as information service apparatuses. Along with the popularization of Web techniques many image processing apparatuses such as a line printer LP a multi function printer MFP etc. have been provided with a Web server function so as to respond to a request from a client on a network by providing information regarding a status or structure of the apparatus and setting of the network in the form of a Web page.

On the other hand with the internationalization in recent years users using information service apparatuses of the same model have become not always use the same language. In order to cope with such circumstances there are many apparatuses available on the market that can provide the same information in various different languages.

A Web server which offers the same information in various languages judges a language which a user desires to use in accordance with a value of an Accept Language field contained in a Uniform Resource Locater URL requested by a Web client or a request header of a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol HTTP and provides Web pages in the thus judged language.

However there a case where a language is not clearly designated by a Web client for example there in no input of designation in the Accept Language field or even if the designation of a language is provided the Web server does not support the designated language. In such a case a Web page is provided to the Web client in a predetermined language that is previously set irrespective of user s designation. That is there are many cases where a Web page is described in English as an international common language.

However there is a problem in that English is not always a language that can be easily understood by users of the Web server.

It is a general object of the present invention to provide an information service apparatus and method information display apparatus and information service system in which the above mentioned problems are eliminated.

A more specific object of the present invention is to provide an information service apparatus and method information display apparatus and information service system which can provide information described in a language suitable for a user.

According to the above mentioned information service apparatus information can be provided to a user in a language suitable for the user since the information is displayed in the language used in a display on the operation panel of the information service apparatus when the information service apparatus is incapable of providing the information in the language requested by the terminal.

Additionally the information service apparatus according to the present invention may further comprise discrimination information existence judgment means for judging whether the discrimination information is contained in the request from the terminal wherein the language determination means may set the operation panel language as the language used for providing the information when the discrimination information existence judgment means judges that the discrimination information is not contained in the request from the terminal.

Accordingly even when the terminal does not provided a clear designation of the language to be used information can be provided to a user in a language suitable for the user since the information is displayed in a language that is used in a display on the operation panel of the information service apparatus and has a high possibility for a user to understand the language.

Further in the above mentioned information service apparatus a plurality of languages may be supported as the operation panel language so as to use one language previously selected from among the plurality of languages when displaying the operation information on the operation panel.

Accordingly the above mentioned information service apparatus can provide information in a language selected from among a plurality of supported languages when it is incapable of providing the information in the language requested by the terminal or when the terminal does not provided clear designation of the language to be used.

Additionally in the information service apparatus according to the present invention when the language designated by the discrimination information contained in the request from the terminal corresponds to neither of the plurality of supported languages the language correspondence judgment means may judge that the information cannot be provided in the language designated by the discrimination information.

Further in the information service apparatus according to the present invention the request from the terminal may be a HTTP request and the discrimination information may be a value of an Accept Language field included in the HTTP request. The information service apparatus may be an image processing apparatus which processes image data.

Additionally there is provided according to another aspect of the present invention an information display apparatus comprising information service request means for sending a send request to an information service apparatus that provides information through a network the send request for requesting the information and designating a language used in displaying the information and information display means for displaying the information received from the information service apparatus wherein when the information service apparatus is incapable of providing the information in the language designated by the information service request means the information display means displays the information received from the information service apparatus in a language used for displaying information on an operation panel of the information service apparatus.

According to the above mentioned information display apparatus information can be provided to a user in a language suitable for the user since the information is displayed in the language which is used in a display on the operation panel of the information service apparatus and has a high possibility for the user to understand the language when the information service apparatus is incapable of providing the information in the language requested by the terminal.

Additionally there is provided according to another aspect of the present invention an information service system comprising a terminal connected to a network and an information service apparatus sending information to the terminal through the network in accordance with a request sent from the terminal wherein the information service apparatus comprises an operation panel on which operation information on the information service apparatus is displayed language correspondence judgment means for judging whether or not the information can be provided in a language designated by discrimination information contained in the request from the terminal and language determination means for determining the language to be used in providing the information wherein when the language correspondence judgment means determines that the information in the language designated by the discrimination information cannot be provided the language determination means sets an operation panel language used for displaying the operation information on the operation panel as the language used for providing the information and wherein the terminal displays the information in the language determined by the language determination means.

Further there is provided according to another aspect of the present invention an information service method for providing information from an information service apparatus to a terminal connected to the information service apparatus through a network in accordance with a request sent from the terminal comprising a language correspondence judgment procedure of judging whether or not the information can be provided in a language designated by discrimination information contained in the request from the terminal and a language determination procedure of determining the language to be used in providing the information wherein when the language correspondence judgment procedure determines that the information in the language designated by the discrimination information cannot be provided the language determination procedure sets an operation panel language used for displaying the operation information on the operation panel as the language used for providing the information.

Other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A description will be given below with reference to the drawings of an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment an image processing apparatus is explained as an example of an information service apparatus.

A shown in the image processing apparatus according to the present embodiment comprises hardware resources such as a plotter engine and a scanner engine for performing image processing individually an engine control board an operating system OS a system management service a network service a memory management service an operation panel management service an engine management service and various kinds of applications such as a copy application a fax application a printer application a Web application etc.

The engine control board controls each functional part of the image processing apparatus such as the plotter engine and the scanner engine so as to provide the functions of the engine control board to the operating system .

The operating system can be achieved by for example UNIX trade mark and is capable of concurrently performing various kinds of software as processes such as the copy application the fax application etc.

The system management service the network service the memory management service the operation panel management service and the engine management service provide their functions to higher order applications such as the copy application etc. through an application programming interface API . That is the system management service provides a function regarding a system management and the network service provides a function regarding network communications. Moreover the memory management service provides a function regarding a memory management and the operation panel management service provides a function regarding an operation panel provided in the image processing apparatus . Further the engine management service provides a function for controlling the plotter engine and the scanner engine through the engine control board .

The copy application is for achieving a copy function of the image processing apparatus . The fax application is for achieving a facsimile function of the image processing apparatus . The printer application has a page description language PDL a printer control language PCL and a postscript PS so as to achieve a printer function of the image processing apparatus . The Web application which provides a function relating to the present invention provides various kinds of information in a language suitable for a remote user to terminals connected to the image processing apparatus through the network in a language suitable for the users of the terminals.

A description will now be given with reference to of a function as a Web server of the image forming apparatus which is achieved by the above mentioned Web application and network service . is a diagram showing an example of a functional structure of the image processing apparatus as a Web server. The image processing apparatus shown in comprises an incorporative Web server a language processing section a language information management table a Web application a Web application etc. The image processing apparatus is connected with terminals and through the network such as a local area network LAN an intranet or the Internet.

The incorporative Web server corresponds to a program generally referred to as HTTPd HTTP daemon for causing the image processing apparatus to serve as a Web server. Upon receipt of a send request HTTP request of a Web page sent from the terminal etc. the Web server inquires the language processing section of a language a natural language hereinafter referred to as a display language used for producing a Web page that provides predetermined information. Then the Web server sends a request to the Web application to produce a Web page described in the display language notified by the language processing section . Furthermore the incorporative Web server sends as an HTTP request the Web page of HTML format produced by the Web application to the terminal . It should be noted that the incorporative Web server is mounted as a part of the function of the network service in .

The language processing section is a module for judging the display language suitable for the terminal to which the send request of the Web page was sent. The language processing section judges a desired display language with reference to the language information management table . The language information management table manages information regarding available display languages supported by the image processing apparatus and also information regarding a language hereinafter referred to as an operation panel language currently used for the displayed object on the operation panel of the image processing apparatus .

Here the operation panel is a panel provided in the image processing apparatus for displaying operation information for operating an image processing apparatus to the user of the image processing apparatus . Accordingly the image processing apparatus is capable of selecting the operation panel language from among a plurality of previously installed languages in accordance with the user s designation. Thus if the user designates for example Japanese language as the operation panel language the image processing apparatus displays the operation information on the operation panel in Japanese. It should be noted in the image processing apparatus according to the preset embodiment it is supposed that Japanese language and English language are supported and Japanese language is selected as the operation panel language.

The Web application and the Web application hereinafter may be referred to as Web application as a whole perform a predetermined process to produce a web page which displays information regarding the image processing apparatus in the language display language notified by the incorporative Web server .

The terminals and are a personal computer PC a personal digital data assistant PDA and a portable phone having Web browsers and respectively. The users of the terminals and can check the information on the image processing apparatus through the respective web browsers and .

In a general Web browser it is possible to set up a use language. The language set in a Web browser is specified as a value of the Accept Language field included in a request header of the HTTP request when sending the HTTP request to the Web server. For example the value of the Accept Language field is set to ja if Japanese language is set as the use language of a web browser the value of the Accept Language field is set to en us if American English is set as the use language and the value of the Accept Language field is set to cs if Czechoslovak language is set as the use language. In the present embodiment it is assumed that Czechoslovak language is set in the web browser Japanese language is set in the web browser and American English language is set in the Web browser . That is it is assumed that the user of the terminal is a Czechoslovak the user of the terminal is Japanese and the user of the terminal is American. Additionally it is assumed that the image processing apparatus and the terminals and are located on the same floor of an Office building in Japan.

A description will now be given with reference to of a process procedure performed by the image processing apparatus shown in . is a sequence diagram for explaining an outline of the process performed in the image processing apparatus .

In step S when the Czechoslovakia user of the terminal inputs an IP address or URL of the image processing apparatus into the web browser so as to check information on the image processing apparatus the Web browser sends the HTTP request which requires transmission of a Web page to the image processing apparatus . Here the value of the Accept Language field included in the request header of the HTTP request to be sent is set to cs .

Following step S the routine proceeds to step S where the incorporative Web server of the image processing apparatus which received the HTTP request from the Web browser inquires the language processing section about the display language. Following step S the routine proceeds to step S where the language processing section performs a predetermined process mentioned later so as to determine the display language. Then the language processing section outputs a character string for discriminating the determined display language for example Japanese language if Japanese language is set as the display language to the Web server .

As mentioned above the user of the terminal uses Czechoslovakia language. However the languages supported in the image processing apparatus are Japanese language and English language. Thus in the present embodiment the language processing section determines a language which has a high possibility that the user of the terminal can understand as the display language by performing a process mentioned later.

Following step S the routine proceeds to step S where the incorporative Web server calls the Web application which corresponds to the URL designated in the HTTP request. It should be noted that when calling the Web application incorporative Web server notifies the Web application of the display language.

Following step S the routine proceeds to step S where the Web application performs the predetermined process so as to produce Web pages with a HTML format. For example if the Web application is to produce the Web page that displays the status information of the image processing apparatus the Web application acquires the status information of the image processing apparatus through the API so as to produce the Web page which displays the acquired information in the display language. Accordingly if the display language is Japanese the Web application produces the Web page displayed in Japanese.

Following step S the routine proceeds to step S where the Web application outputs the produced Web page to the incorporative Web server . Then the Web server sends in step S the Web page to the browser .

Following step S the routine proceeds to step S where the Web browser displays the received Web page. It should be noted that the display of Web page is not in Czechoslovakia language but in Japanese or English. However since the language processing section determines the language which has high possibility that the user of the terminal can understand as the display language it is highly possible that the Czechoslovakia user of the terminal can understand the contents of the Web page by viewing the Web page.

A description will now be given with reference to of the process of step S in detail. is a flowchart of a process for determining the display language performed by the language processing section .

In step S the language processing section determines whether a value is set in the Accept Language field notified by the incorporative Web server . It is because the Accept Language field may not be provided in the request header depending on a mounted state of a Web browser. If the Accept Language field is set up the routine proceeds to step S. On the other hand if the Accept Language field is not set up the routine proceeds to step S. In this case cs Czechoslovak language is set up and thus the routine proceeds to step S.

In step S the language processing section acquires a list of languages which the image processing apparatus is supporting from the language information management table .

Following step S the routine proceeds to step S where the language processing section determines whether or not there is any language which matches the language hereinafter referred to as a request language specified in the Accept Language field among the support languages. If there is a language that matches the request language among the support languages the routine proceeds to step S. On the other hand if there is no language that matches the request language among the support languages the routine proceeds to step S. In this case the request language is cs and the support languages are ja and en us and thus the request language corresponds to neither of the support languages. Accordingly the routine proceeds to step S. It should be noted that if a plurality of languages are specified in the Accept Language fields the language processing section determines whether or not there is any language which matches the support language with respect to all languages specified in the Acceptance Language field.

In step S the language processing section determines the operation panel language based on information in the operation panel language column of the language information management table . Since the operation panel language is ja as shown in the language processing section determines that the language Japanese discriminated by ja is the operation panel language. Following step S the routine proceeds to step S where the language processing section determines the operation panel language as the display language and outputs a value of ja to the incorporative Web server .

It should be noted that if the request language is included in the support languages in the case of Yes of S that is when an HTTP request is received from the Web browser or the Web browser the language processing section determines in step S the request language as the display language as it is and outputs discrimination information of the display language to the incorporative Web server .

As mentioned above the image processing apparatus according to the present embodiment produces a Web page using an operation panel as a display language when there is no designation of the request language made by a remote terminal or when the language designated as the request language is not supported in the image processing apparatus . Therefore the Web page described in the operation panel is displayed on the remote terminal.

In a Web server that exhibits information all over the world it cannot narrow down languages which users use since the users accessing the Web server are located all over the world. However in the Web site provided by an incorporative device such as the image processing apparatus users who accesses are limited to a quite narrow range.

For example if the image processing apparatus is located on a floor of an office persons who want to access the image processing apparatus are limited to persons on that floor. That is they are persons who actually operate the image processing apparatus using the operation panel. Moreover persons working in a place limited to some extent should communicate normally by a common language. For example as in the office in Japan as in the present embodiment the users of the terminals and should communicate with each other using Japanese language.

Thus the language operation panel language displayed on the operation panel of the image processing apparatus should be set to the language which the persons on the floor can commonly understand. That is it is highly possible that the Czechoslovak user of the terminal understands the operation panel language and it is possible very much that the Czechoslovak user of the terminal can access the Web page provided by the image processing apparatus and understand the contents of the Web page.

Therefore it can be said that the image processing apparatus according to the present embodiment has validity very much and makes a rational judgment in providing a Web page according to a language suitable for users within a range of the support languages. The users can access the Web page provided by the image processing apparatus in the language which each user can understand.

It should be noted that although the image processing apparatus is explained as an example of the information service apparatus in the present embodiment the present invention is applicable to other apparatuses that serve as a Web server.

The present invention is not limited to the specifically disclosed embodiments and variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
