This application is a 371 of PCT JP11 50774 filed Jan. 18 2011. Priority to Japanese patent application 2010 008998 filed Jan. 19 2010 and Japanese patent application 2010 169535 filed Jul. 28 2010 are claimed.

The present invention relates to a conductive film with excellent transparency and conductivity and to a method for its production.

Conductive films with excellent transparency are widely used for such purposes as display electrodes for flat panel displays such as plasma displays and liquid crystal displays transparent electrodes for touch panels transparent electrodes for solar cells and electromagnetic wave shielding films.

Tin doped indium oxide Indium Tin Oxide hereunder referred to as ITO is well known as a material for forming conductive films with excellent transparency. ITO films are produced by gas phase methods such as sputtering or vacuum vapor deposition but gas phase methods require high vacuum apparatuses and large equipment investment. The equipment investment and maintenance cost becomes particularly immense for purposes that require large sized areas. Furthermore since the component gas pressure in the production apparatus must be precisely controlled for production of each ITO film this affects the production cost and productivity.

One method for solving this problem is a method of forming an ITO film by coating an ITO fine particle dispersion and drying it PTL 1 . However ITO films are associated with numerous problems that must be overcome such as the high cost of indium difficulty of increasing conductivity while maintaining transparency and susceptibility to bending.

Development of conductive films that employ conductive materials instead of ITO has been advancing in recent years. Notably methods of forming mesh like or other patterns with dispersions of metal fine particles or extra fine wires in solution by screen printing ink jet printing or utilizing a self organization phenomenon have been proposed Patent documents 2 6 .

In printing methods however productivity is reduced due to clogging of the mesh or nozzle and it is difficult to form intricate patterns with line widths of less than 6 m. Patterns with approximately 2 m widths have reportedly been formed by ink jet printing but very long time periods are necessary due to the small coating amounts used and such methods are therefore poorly suitable for industrial scale production. Moreover with a self organization phenomenon which utilizes hydrophilic hydrophobic interaction between the substrate and solution this prohibits free selection of the substrate and complicates control of the pattern shape.

In one of the proposed photolithographic methods a copper foil is attached to a transparent base and photolithography is employed for etching PTL 7 . This method allows fine processing to produce a mesh with a high open area ratio high transmittance while the conductivity is also high. However photolithographic methods are essentially utilized for processing of small sized areas and are not easily adaptable for large areas.

Methods using electrodeposited meshes have been proposed in which a mesh like metal electrodeposition layer having a metal electrolyte solution electrodeposited on an electrodeposition substrate is bonded and transferred to a transparent base PTL 8 . PTL 8 discloses a mesh with a line width of 30 m. This method produces an easily recognizable thick line width mesh form. However it cannot easily produce fine line widths.

Thus a conductive film with a metal mesh on the surface produced by prior art technology has relatively high conductivity but has been problematic in terms of either fine pattern formation or large area sizes.

It is an object of the invention to provide a method for producing a conductive film with excellent transparency and conductivity by a simple method suitable for large area production.

As a result of much diligent research with the aim of obtaining such a conductive film the present inventors have found that by placing a template with the same shape as the pattern that is to be formed on a substrate surface spreading a dispersion comprising a conductive material such as a metal on the substrate surface and drying the dispersing medium a pattern with the same shape as the template is formed on the substrate surface with a finer line width than the template line width. It was also found that the formed pattern can be easily transferred to a substrate such as a film by a transfer method and the present invention was thus completed.

Specifically the invention is a method for producing a conductive film comprising a step of placing a template B having openings in a mesh structure running from the side that is to contact a substrate A through to the back side on the surface of the substrate A and spreading a dispersion D of conductive particles P on the surface of the substrate A on which the template B has been placed and drying it thereby forming a mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P near the points of contact between the substrate A and the template B and then removing the template B from the substrate A to form a mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P on the surface of the substrate A .

The invention is also the aforementioned method for producing a conductive film further comprising after formation of the mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P on the surface of the substrate A a step of forming a resin layer on the surface of the substrate A and placing a substrate E thereover and then releasing the substrate A to transfer the mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P onto the surface of the substrate E .

The invention is also a conductive film having a fine pattern formed by a conductor on a substrate surface the conductive film having the following features a to c .

 c The shape of the cross section of the thin wires of the fine pattern has a segment structure that traces an ascending arc.

The production method of the invention is a method that allows large area formation of conductive films with excellent transparency and conductivity by a simple process and therefore its industrial value is high.

Since the conductive film of the invention has excellent transparency and conductivity and can be produced in a simple manner its industrial value is high.

The conductive film of the invention can be produced by including a step of placing a template B having openings in a mesh structure running from the side that is to contact a substrate A through to the back side on the surface of the substrate A and spreading a dispersion D of conductive particles P on the surface of the substrate A on which the template B has been placed and drying it thereby forming a mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P near the points of contact between the substrate A and the template B and then removing the template B from the substrate A to form a mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P on the surface of the substrate A .

The conductive film of the invention can also be produced by including a step of spreading a dispersion D of conductive particles P on the surface of a substrate A placing a template B having openings in a mesh structure running from the side that is to contact the substrate A through to the back side over the dispersion D that has been developed on the surface of the substrate A and drying it thereby forming a mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P near the points of contact between the substrate A and the template B and then removing the template B from the substrate A to form a mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P on the surface of the substrate A .

The substrate A to be used for the invention preferably has a contact angle of 0.1 50 between its surface and the dispersion D of conductive particles P the contact angle being more preferably 0.1 30 and even more preferably 0.1 20 .

In order for the contact angle between the surface of the substrate A and the dispersion D of conductive particles P to be within this range the substrate A is preferably subjected to surface pretreatment. The method of surface treatment may be for example UV irradiation excimer irradiation plasma irradiation corona discharge electron beam treatment or the like or washing treatment with an organic solvent such as acetone or alcohol.

The form of the substrate A may be flat or film like for example. It is preferably flat from the viewpoint of easier management.

The material of the substrate A may be for example glass a metal such as stainless steel or aluminum or a resin such as polyester resin or acrylic resin.

When the substrate A on which the mesh like structure C has been formed is to be used as a transparent conductive member a transparent base such as glass or a transparent resin may be selected as the substrate A .

When a transparent resin is used as the substrate A it is preferably one with a Young s modulus of 0.5 GPa or greater a heat shrinkage factor of not greater than 1 at 130 C. and a melting point of 70 C. or higher and preferably the film thickness is at least 15 m.

Examples of transparent resins include polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate acrylic resins such as polymethyl methacrylate polycarbonates polyethersulfones polysulfones polyolefins polyimides polyamides polyamideimides and polystyrene.

When a sintering step is necessary for the mesh like structure C the material of the substrate A must be selected in consideration of the sintering temperature.

The template B to be used for the invention has openings in the mesh structure running from the substrate A contacting side s through to the back side r . The dispersing medium of the dispersion D of conductive particles P described hereunder can be evaporated through these openings. At the sections without openings the edge sections of the mesh of the template the conductive particles P can be accumulated in a self organizing phenomenon by surface tension.

In order to accumulate the conductive particles P in a self organizing by surface tension at the edge sections of the mesh of the template preferably all of the edges of the template facing the substrate A are edges that are not contacted to the substrate A . Even if the substrate A and the template B are contacted the template B will be pushed up by surface tension of the dispersion D during the drying step of steps 1 to 3 described below.

The template B may be for example a wire mesh made of stainless steel aluminum or the like. In a wire mesh that is a plain weave or twill weave of thin wires made of stainless steel or aluminum in particular the intersections at the mesh edges become raised and this is preferred since the edges of the mesh will not be contacted to the substrate A when it is placed on the substrate A .

It is also preferred to subject the template B to surface pretreatment by the same method as for preliminary surface treatment of the substrate A mentioned above.

When such a wire mesh is used the line widths of the mesh like structure C and the widths of the openings formed by the production method of the invention can be adjusted by the diameters of the wires of the wire mesh and the widths of the openings. The cross sections of the wires used may be round rectilinear or another shape. The opening widths are the spacings between the wires forming the wire mesh. The pitch of the wire mesh is the spacing between the centers of the wires forming the wire mesh.

A template with a mesh structure formed by electroforming or a microsieve may also be used as the template B . When a microsieve is used fine particles for example nano or micro sized silica particles are preferably adhered or fused to the surface and the substrate A is mounted with the silica particle adhered or fused side facing the substrate A .

According to the production method of the invention it is possible to form on the substrate A a mesh like structure C having a line width of about 1 10 to of the diameter of the wire mesh wires used in the template B .

The wire diameter is preferably 5 60 m and more preferably 10 30 m. If the wire diameter is 5 60 m the line width of the mesh like structure C that is formed will also be narrow and the transparency of the obtained conductive film will be high. When a microsieve is used as the template the widths of the edges of the mesh are preferably approximately the same as the diameters of the wires.

If the template B has a regular mesh structure without defects the pattern of the conductive film formed using the template will also have a regular mesh structure. A regular mesh structure is a mesh structure wherein all of the meshes have the same form.

For example if a square mesh a rectangular mesh or a regular hexagon mesh are connected with common edges they have a regular mesh structure. Connection in a regular mesh structure will result in uniform conductivity. That is the same conductivity will be exhibited at any location.

Examples of conductive particles P to be used for the invention include metal fine particles conductive polymer fine particles and carbon particles.

Examples of metal fine particles include metals such as Au Ag Cu Ni Pt Pd Fe Cr Zn and Sn their oxides and alloys of such metals. Preferred among these are Au Ag Cu and Pt because of their high conductivity. From the viewpoint of cost Ag Cu and nickel silver an alloy of Cu Zn and Ni are preferred. The metal fine particles may be of a single type or a combination of 2 or more types.

Examples of conductive polymers include polyaniline polythiophene polypyrrole and their derivatives. The conductive polymer may be of a single type or a combination of 2 or more types.

The weight average particle size of the conductive particles P is preferably 1 1000 nm more preferably 1 100 nm even more preferably 1 30 nm and most preferably 1 20 nm. A smaller weight average particle size of the conductive particles P will result in a higher shape following property for the pattern shape of the template B .

The solid content of the dispersion D of conductive particles P is preferably 0.01 80 mass more preferably 0.01 10 mass even more preferably 0.01 5 mass and most preferably 0.01 3 mass . A lower solid content of the dispersion D will result in a more narrow line width of the mesh like structure C and therefore a lighter tint and a more highly transparent conductive film.

The dispersing medium of the dispersion D may be for example water or an organic solvent such as alcohol. Water is preferred because it has a suitable evaporation rate and lacks VOC Volatile Organic Compounds . The dispersing medium may be of a single type or a combination of 2 or more types.

The mesh like structure C of the invention may be formed by either the following production method 1 or 2 changing the order of development of the dispersion D of conductive particles P on the surface of the substrate A . Since this method employs a template with openings in a mesh structure mesh like template it is possible to easily obtain a conductive film with a mesh like pattern.

As used herein conductive film refers to a film or sheet with conductivity comprising a mesh like structure C formed by conductive particles P or such a structure that has been conductively treated hereunder referred to as mesh like structured product and a substrate or resin layer.

Also as used herein conductive film may refer to either a mesh like structure C or mesh like structured product for convenience.

The production method of the invention may be used for convenient production even for conductive films with large areas on the meter sized order.

Step 1 1 The template B is placed on the surface of the substrate A so as to prevent its sliding during the subsequent steps 1 2 and 1 3. 

Step 1 2 The dispersion D of conductive particles P is developed on the substrate A on which the template B has been placed from the top side of the template B . 

Step 1 3 The dispersing medium of the dispersion D is dried causing self organizing formation of a mesh like structure C in which the conductive particles P have concentrated near the points of contact between the substrate A and the template B .

Step 1 4 The template B is removed to form a mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P on the surface of the substrate A thus obtaining a mesh like structured product. 

Step 2 2 A template B is placed on the surface of the substrate A on which the dispersion D has been developed so as to prevent its sliding during the subsequent step 2 3. 

Step 2 3 The dispersing medium of the dispersion D is dried causing self organizing formation of a mesh like structure C in which the conductive particles P have concentrated near the points of contact between the substrate A and the template B .

Step 2 4 The template B is removed to form a mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P on the surface of the substrate A thus obtaining a mesh like structured product. 

While a mesh like structured product can be easily obtained by either production method 1 or 2 production method 1 is preferred for a more satisfactory yield.

In the production method of the invention it is possible to form a pattern with the same shape as the template B on the surface of the substrate A and with a narrower line width than the line width of the template B . For example if a stainless steel wire mesh is used as the template B a mesh like structured product composed of the conductive particles P with a line width of about 1 10 to of the diameter of the stainless steel wires composing the wire mesh will be formed on the surface of the substrate A .

The phenomenon by which the line width of the mesh like structured product is significantly narrower than the line width of the template B is a phenomenon that has been discovered by the present inventors.

It is conjectured that this phenomenon occurs because the template B is pushed upward by surface tension of the dispersion D during drying of the dispersion D in step 1 3 or 2 3 thus promoting drying while the conductive particles P become concentrated on the surface of the substrate A below the thin wires forming the template B .

In the production method of the invention it is possible to easily form a film wherein the cross sectional shapes of the wires of the mesh like structured product are each a segment convex segment that traces an ascending arc. If the cross sectional shapes of the wires are arched segments the surface resistance value will be low and transfer will be facilitated in the subsequent transfer step.

In this step the template B is placed on the surface of the substrate A . When production method 1 is to be carried out by a batch operation a known type of adhesive or adhesive tape may be used to prevent slippage until step 1 4 in which the template B is removed from the substrate A .

However if bonding is formed on the surface of the substrate A a mesh like structured product will not be formed on those sections and therefore the bonded sections are preferably at the corners of the substrate.

The substrate A and the template B do not need to be firmly contacted. The spacing between the substrate A and the side s of the template B that contacts with the substrate A is preferably 0.01 20 m and more preferably 0.01 m 2 m. If the spacing between the substrate A and side s is within this range a mesh like structured product will be obtained that almost completely reproduces the pattern shape of the template B .

This is a step of spreading the dispersion D of conductive particles P as the starting material for the mesh like structured product on the substrate A over which the template B has been placed. In this step it is sufficient for the dispersion D to be developed on one side of the sections where the mesh like structured product is to be formed and there is no restriction so long as the method allows uniform introduction into the openings of the template B without slippage of the template B from the substrate A .

The method of introducing the dispersion D into the openings may be for example spin coating doctor blading dip coating spraying or shear coating.

As mentioned above surface pretreatment of the substrate A reduces the contact angle with the dispersion D and limiting the contact angle between the template B and the dispersion D to not greater than 50 and preferably not greater than 30 allows rapid development of the dispersion D on one side by surface tension even when the dispersion D has been partially dropped onto the substrate A on which the template B has been placed.

This is a step of drying the dispersing medium of the dispersion D evaporating removal after the dispersion D has been developed. The drying temperature is preferably 0 C. to 100 C. more preferably 3 C. to 60 C. and even more preferably 3 C. to 30 C.

The method of drying the dispersing medium may be for example allowing it to stand drying with hot air or drying under reduced pressure below atmospheric pressure. The drying conditions preferably include a drying time of 10 seconds or longer preferably 30 seconds or longer and even more preferably 1 minute or longer.

During the process of drying the dispersing medium the conductive particles P accumulate at the sections where the template B and substrate are contacted or in close approach by a self organizing phenomenon. As a result a pattern with the same shape as the template B is successively formed.

If the other conditions are the same a lower drying temperature results in a slower drying speed and a higher shape following property for the pattern of the template B allowing more dense wiring to be formed.

The mesh like structured product is formed in a self organizing phenomenon in this step because during the process of drying the dispersing medium the conductive particles P are concentrated while being attracted toward the gaps between the substrate A and the template B by the surface tension of the dispersing medium itself.

After drying of the dispersing medium steps 1 2 to 1 3 may be repeated. This can further increase the conductivity of the conductive film.

This is a step of removing the template B from the substrate A . The method is not particularly restricted so long as the mesh like structured product that has formed is not destroyed.

This is a step of spreading the dispersion D of conductive particles P as the starting material for the mesh like structured product on the surface of the substrate A . In this step it is sufficient for the dispersion D to be developed on one side of the sections on which the mesh like structured product is to be formed.

The method of spreading the dispersion D may be for example spin coating doctor blading dip coating spraying or shear coating.

This is a step of placing the template B on the substrate A over the dispersion D that has been developed on the substrate A in step 2 1. There are no particular restrictions on the method of placing the template B so long as the dispersion D developed in step 2 1 is not dried and sections without the dispersion are not generated by surface tension. The method of placing the template B may be the method described in step 1 1.

After drying the dispersion D of conductive particles P may be further developed again and step 2 3 carried out. This can further increase the conductivity of the conductive film comprising the mesh like structured product.

The mesh like structured product obtained according to the invention can have a line width of about 1 10 to of the line width of the template B . The line width of the mesh like structured product is preferably 0.5 6 m.

The transparency of the mesh like structured product may be freely varied by changing the widths of the openings of the template B . When a microsieve is used as the template B the high regularity of the microsieve results in excellent regularity of the pattern of the obtained mesh like structured product as well.

If the line width of the mesh like structured product is 0.5 6 m the widths of the openings of the mesh like structured product will be adjustable so that the light transmittance is 80 or greater when the conductive film is formed on a 1 mm thick glass board light transmittance 90 93 for example.

Since the mesh like structured product of the invention allows line widths of a fine size not possible by the prior art it is possible to reduce the opening widths.

With the large line widths of the prior art it has been necessary to increase the opening widths in order to increase the transparency of the mesh like structured product. Because the openings are insulated sections increasing the transparency enlarges the insulated sections resulting in inadequate performance as a transparent conductive film.

The mesh like structured product obtained according to the invention may be subjected to conductive treatment by known means after the mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P has been formed. Examples of conductive treatment include methods using a kiln heating with a laser or electron beam or removal of the dispersing agent using a chemical solution. Methods of sintering by heating are convenient and preferred.

Metal fine particles are generally in the form of a dispersion in water or an organic solvent with a dispersing agent adsorbed on the surface to maintain the dispersion stability. When metal fine particles are used as the conductive particles P sintering after formation of the mesh like structure C by the metal fine particles can fuse the metal fine particles together and form a highly conductive film.

The heating temperature for sintering is preferably 50 C. to 600 C. and more preferably 100 C. to 450 C. The sintering time will differ depending on the heating temperature and the physical properties of the dispersion D but it is preferably about 5 30 minutes.

The sintering may be carried out after the template B has been removed in step 1 4 or step 2 4 or before removing it.

The conductive film obtained according to the invention may be subjected to electroplating after the mesh like structure C of the conductive particles P has been formed using the formed conductive film as an electrode. This can improve the conductivity by increasing the density of the metal thin wires.

In this case however the plating formation speed is increased and the line width and film thickness of the conductive film are drastically increased and therefore the metal ion concentration of the electroplating bath the voltage and the current value must be adjusted.

According to the invention the conductive film may also be coated immobilized with a transparent resin or the like without carrying out the transfer step described hereunder. When the substrate A is a transparent base of glass or the like a transparent conductive substrate can thus be obtained.

In this case however a coating layer that is thicker than the conductive film will result in the conductive film being completely covered by the transparent resin and this will eliminate the conductivity of the substrate surface. When it is desired to increase the adhesiveness of the conductive film on the substrate while maintaining the conductivity of the surface of the transparent conductive substrate it will be necessary to adjust the thickness of the coating layer.

The conductive film obtained according to the invention may be coated with a transparent conductive film such as zinc oxide or tin oxide. This can impart conductivity to the openings which normally consists of an insulating layer. Examples of transparent conductive films include zinc oxide tin oxide fluorine doped tin oxide tin doped indium oxide aluminum doped zinc oxide and gallium doped zinc oxide.

The method of forming the transparent conductive film may be any method known in the prior art. Examples include vacuum vapor deposition sputtering ion plating thermal decomposition spray CVD colloid methods and sol gel methods.

In the production method of the invention if a resin layer is further formed on the surface of the substrate A after the mesh like structured product has been formed on the surface of the substrate A and the obtained resin layer is released from the substrate A the mesh like structured product can thus be transferred onto the surface of the resin layer transfer method 1 .

For example a resin layer may be formed by coating a monomer composition X on the surface of the substrate A after the mesh like structured product has been formed on the surface of the substrate A and polymerizing it and the obtained resin layer may be released from the substrate A to transfer the mesh like structured product onto the surface of the resin layer. As a separate method a resin layer may be formed by coating a resin composition Y onto the surface of the substrate A instead of a monomer composition X .

Alternatively in the production method of the invention a monomer composition X or resin composition Y may be further coated on the surface of the substrate A after the mesh like structured product has been formed on the surface of the substrate A and a substrate E may be placed thereover a resin layer subsequently formed and the substrate E then released from the substrate A to transfer the mesh like structured product onto the surface of the substrate E transfer method 2 . For example if a substrate E is placed on a monomer composition X that has been coated on the surface of the substrate A and then a resin layer is formed by polymerizing the monomer composition X after which the substrate E is released from the substrate A it will be possible to transfer the mesh like structured product onto the surface of the substrate E using the polymer of the monomer composition X as a binder. As a separate method a monomer composition X that has been coated onto the surface of the substrate A may be half cured and then a substrate E placed on the half cured monomer composition X and the half cured monomer composition X subsequently polymerized to form a resin layer after which the substrate E may be released from the substrate A to transfer the mesh like structured product onto the surface of the substrate E using the polymer of the monomer composition X as a binder.

Before the monomer composition X or resin composition Y is coated it is preferred to pretreat the surface of the substrate A on which the mesh like structured product has been formed by UV irradiation excimer irradiation plasma irradiation corona discharge treatment or electron beam treatment. Such a procedure will facilitate transfer of the mesh like structured product.

The monomer composition X to be used for the invention is a photocuring monomer composition X1 or thermosetting monomer composition X2 and a single type may be used alone or 2 or more may be used in combination.

When a transparent substrate is to be used as the substrate E the difference in refractive index between the obtained polymer resin layer and the substrate E is preferably not greater than 0.1. A smaller difference in refractive index between the polymer resin layer and the substrate E will result in higher transparency. The refractive index can be measured according to JIS K 7105 using a KPR 2 by Carnyu Optical Industries.

When a photocuring monomer composition X1 is used the photocuring monomer composition X1 coated on the surface of the substrate A may be irradiated with an active energy beam such as ultraviolet rays for polymerization to transfer the conductive film.

The photocuring monomer composition X1 comprises a vinyl monomer x1 and a photopolymerization initiator x2 .

The blending ratio is preferably 0.1 10 parts by weight of the photopolymerization initiator x2 with respect to 100 parts by weight of the vinyl monomer x1 for optimal curing speed. If the photopolymerization initiator x2 is at least 0.1 part by weight the curability of the photocuring monomer composition X1 will be improved. If the photopolymerization initiator x2 is not greater than 10 parts by weight coloration of the obtained polymer will be inhibited.

The vinyl monomer x1 may be for example a vinyl monomer with at least two vinyl groups x1 1 or a vinyl monomer with one vinyl group x1 2 .

Examples of vinyl monomers with at least two vinyl groups x1 1 include diethyleneglycol di meth acrylate triethyleneglycol di meth acrylate tetraethyleneglycol di meth acrylate polybutyleneglycol di meth acrylate 1 4 butanediol di meth acrylate 1 6 hexanediol di meth acrylate 1 9 nonanediol di meth acrylate trimethylolpropane tri meth acrylate pentaerythritol tetra meth acrylate glycerin tri meth acrylate and dipentaerythritol hexa meth acrylate. There may also be mentioned known ester poly meth acrylates known urethane poly meth acrylates known epoxy poly meth acrylates and known ethylene oxide modified bisphenol A di meth acrylates.

Examples of vinyl monomers with one vinyl group x1 2 include methyl meth acrylate ethyl meth acrylate butyl meth acrylate hexyl meth acrylate cyclohexyl meth acrylate dicyclopentenyl meth acrylate phenyl meth acrylate benzyl meth acrylate phenoxyethyl meth acrylate isobornyl meth acrylate 2 hydroxyethyl meth acrylate phosphoethyl meth acrylate and styrene.

When vinyl monomer x1 1 and vinyl monomer x1 2 are used in combination as the vinyl monomer x1 the vinyl monomer x1 2 is used at preferably 0.1 20 parts by weight more preferably 0.5 15 parts by weight and even more preferably 1 10 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of vinyl monomer x1 1 . If the vinyl monomer x1 2 is used at 0.1 part by weight or greater it will be possible to lower the viscosity of the photocuring monomer composition X1 . If the vinyl monomer x1 2 is used at not greater than 20 parts by weight the heat resistance of the obtained polymer will not be lowered.

Examples for the photopolymerization initiator x2 include carbonyl compounds such as benzoin monomethyl ether benzophenone 1 hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone IRGACURE184 Ciba Japan 2 hydroxy 1 4 4 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropionyl benzyl phenyl 2 methylpropan 1 one IRGACURE127 Ciba Japan sulfur compounds such as tetramethylthiuram monosulfide and tetramethylthiuram disulfide acylphosphine oxides such as 2 4 6 trimethylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide and bis 2 4 6 trimethylbenzoyl phenylphosphine oxide and bis 5 2 4 cyclopentadien 1 yl bis 2 6 difluoro 3 1H pyrrol 1 yl phenyl titanium IRGACURE784 Ciba Japan . Preferred among these are 1 hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone 2 hydroxy 1 4 4 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropionyl benzyl phenyl 2 methylpropan 1 one and 2 4 6 trimethylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide for their excellent curability.

The light source for the active energy beam to be used for photocuring may be for example a chemical lamp low pressure mercury lamp high pressure mercury lamp metal halide lamp electrodeless UV lamp product of Fusion UV Systems KK. visible light halogen lamp xenon lamp or sunlight.

The atmosphere during active energy beam irradiation may be air or an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon.

The irradiation energy for an active energy beam is preferably such that the cumulative energy in a wavelength range of 200 600 nm and preferably 320 390 nm is 0.01 10 J cmand preferably 0.5 8 J cm.

The active energy beam is preferably irradiated from the front side where the substrate A side is defined as the back side.

When a thermosetting monomer composition X2 is used the thermosetting monomer composition X2 coated on the surface of the substrate A may be heated for polymerization to transfer the mesh like structured product.

The thermosetting monomer composition X2 comprises a vinyl monomer x1 and a thermopolymerization initiator x3 .

The blending ratio is preferably 0.1 10 parts by weight of the thermopolymerization initiator x3 with respect to 100 parts by weight of the vinyl monomer x1 for optimal curing speed. If the thermopolymerization initiator x3 is at least 0.1 part by weight the curability of the thermosetting monomer composition X2 will be improved. If the thermopolymerization initiator x3 is not greater than 10 parts by weight coloration of the obtained polymer will be inhibited.

The vinyl monomer x1 to be used in the thermosetting monomer composition X2 is the same as the vinyl monomer x1 to be used in the photocuring monomer composition X1 .

Examples for the thermopolymerization initiator x3 include azo compounds such as 2 2 azobisisobutyronitrile and 4 4 azobis 4 cyanovaleric acid persulfuric acid compounds such as ammonium persulfate salts and organic peroxides such as diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide p menthane hydroperoxide cumene hydroperoxide and t butyl hydroperoxide.

The thermosetting monomer composition X2 is preferably heated at a temperature of 60 C. to 130 C. for about 0.1 2 hours.

The resin composition Y to be used for the invention is preferably composed mainly of a transparent resin. Examples of transparent resins include acrylic based resins polystyrene based resins acrylonitrile based resins polyamide based resins polyester based resins phenol based resins melamine based resins and epoxy resins.

The resin composition Y is also preferably diluted with a solvent or the like for preparation as a varnish. Examples of solvents include benzene toluene xylene methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone acetone methanol ethanol isopropyl alcohol 2 butanol ethyl acetate butyl acetate propyleneglycol monomethyl ether propyleneglycol monomethyl ether acetate diacetone alcohol and N N dimethylacetamide. The resin composition Y may also contain additives such as an ultraviolet absorber.

If the resin composition Y is coated in molten form it will be possible to form a resin layer. For example when the resin composition Y is used as a dilution with a solvent it may be heated dried after coating to form the resin layer.

The substrate E to be used in transfer method 2 is preferably a transparent material in order to obtain a transparent conductive member.

As transparent materials there are preferred flexible transparent resin films and transparent resin sheets and specifically polyester films such as polyethylene terephthalate PET polyolefin films such as polyethylene or polypropylene polycarbonate films acrylic films and norbornane films.

The production method of the invention is preferably a continuous process from the viewpoint of productivity. A continuous process will now be described using schematic diagrams .

The substrate A is fed to a surface treatment step for adjustment of the contact angle with the dispersion D of conductive particles P and after placing the template B on the top side of the substrate A it is fed to the step for development of the dispersion D and a drying step in that order.

At this time the template B may be formed into a cylindrical or endless belt shape for more efficient continuous formation of the conductive film.

In the surface treatment step the contact angle of the substrate A with respect to the dispersion D is reduced so that the dispersion D is rapidly developed in an even manner on the top side of the substrate A by surface tension.

The substrate A on which the conductive film has been formed may if necessary be fed to step in which the monomer composition X is coated and step in which the monomer composition X is polymerized in that order after surface treatment in the surface treatment step .

After step and before step the substrate E may be pressed against the substrate A on which the monomer composition X has been coated and the monomer composition X polymerized and then the substrate E released from the substrate A to obtain a conductive member product on which the conductive film has been transferred to the substrate E transfer method 2 .

A pressing roll may be used to press the substrate E against the substrate A . The pressing roll functions to push out air that has been taken into in the monomer composition X while spreading the monomer composition X on the surface of the substrate A .

The process from conductive film formation to transfer can be carried out as a series of steps. An example of such a process is conceptually illustrated in .

The substrate A with the conductive film formed thereon and the polymer resin layer with the conductive film transferred transfer method 1 and the substrate E having the conductive film transferred transfer method 2 as obtained according to the invention both exhibit excellent conductivity and are therefore useful as conductive members.

Also the substrate A with the conductive film formed thereon and the polymer resin layer with the conductive film transferred transfer method 1 and the substrate E having the conductive film transferred transfer method 2 as obtained according to the invention both have excellent transparency and are therefore particularly useful as transparent conductive members.

Preferred embodiments of conductive films obtained by the method of the invention are conductive films having fine patterns formed by conductors on substrate surfaces and specifically are conductive films having the following features a to c .

 c The shape of the cross section of the thin wires of the fine pattern has a segment structure that traces an ascending arc.

According to the invention a mesh like structure a is a structure wherein multiple nodes are connected by multiple wires. The mesh structure of a may have a regular mesh like structure or an irregular mesh like structure but a regular mesh like structure is especially preferred.

A regular mesh like structure according to the invention is a mesh structure wherein all of the meshes have the same form. For example if a square mesh a rectangular mesh or a regular hexagon mesh are connected with common edges they have a regular mesh structure.

According to the invention the regular mesh like structure preferably has a regular structure that is continuous across a large area for a conductive film composed of a transparent insulating film and opaque conductor sections since this will have a major effect on the quality of the conductive film.

In the case of a conductive film composed of a transparent insulating film and opaque conductor sections even a regular mesh like structure on the order of not greater than several m will have continuity of the conductive sections and insulated sections and therefore although this may be considered to be non uniform conductivity in the strict sense when the conductive sections and insulated sections are compared this is seldom problematic for use as an actual conductive film.

Regarding the line width of b if the line widths of the conductors as the opaque sections are too small to be confirmed by the naked eye the conductive film will appear transparent and therefore this value must be sufficiently smaller than 30 m which is the lower limit of resolution for human visual perception but the line width is preferably even smaller than this in order to further increase the transparency. According to the invention it is possible to achieve thin wires of 6 m and smaller which have been difficult with existing technology. Regarding the cross sectional shape of c since the cross section is arc shaped the thicknesses of the wires are larger than conductive thin wires produced by prior art technology and therefore the surface resistivity can be reduced.

The conductive film of the invention also preferably has d a light transmittance of 80 or greater with a higher transmittance being preferred for a transparent conductive film. The transmittance is largely affected by the transparent film serving as the base but is also affected by the opening diameters of the conductor sections. A conductive film satisfying the features a to d above exhibits both high conductivity and high transparency and is particularly preferred from the viewpoint of a constant value for surface resistivity at any section of the conductive film surface.

The surface resistivity of the conductive film of the invention is preferably not greater than 100 sq. and even more preferably not greater than 10 sq. The surface resistivity of a conductive film is one of the basic performance values as a product and will determine its application and a value of not greater than 100 sq. will allow development for various purposes including electromagnetic wave shield solar cell and display uses. This is because the conductor on the conductive film hardens due to surface tension on the substrate and the cross section is arc shaped such that the thicknesses of the wires are larger than conductive thin wires produced by prior art technology and the surface resistivity can thus be reduced.

A conductive member obtained according to the invention may be suitably used for purposes such as transparent electrodes for image display devices including plasma displays liquid crystal displays electric field discharge displays electroluminescence displays and electronic paper transparent electrodes for touch panels transparent electrodes for solar cells and electromagnetic wave shielding films.

The invention will now be described in greater detail by examples with the understanding that the invention is not limited to these examples.
