The present disclosure relates generally to networking systems that facilitate communication connections to a receiving user and more particularly to a system that presents to a receiving or target user socially relevant information relating to a calling user.

A social networking system such as a social networking website enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system. The social networking system may create and store a record often referred to as a user profile in connection with the user. The user profile may include a user s demographic information communication channel information and personal interest. The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user s relationship with other users in the social networking system e.g. social graph as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing or instant messaging to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system. For example a user of a social networking website can access an address book stored in the social networking website look up a contact in the address book and connect with the contact through email.

Caller identification or caller ID is a telephone service available in analog and digital phone systems and in most VoIP applications that transmits a caller s phone number to a receiving party s telephony equipment e.g. a mobile phone . When a person receives an incoming call on his phone from a caller the phone can display the caller s phone number if caller ID service is available.

Particular embodiments relate to social network caller identification system that presents social network information of initiators of messages such as phone calls to recipient users. These and other features aspects and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.

The invention is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process steps and or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure. In addition while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary the description is intended to cover alternatives modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.

A social networking system such as a social networking website enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system. Typically to become a registered user of a social networking system an entity either human or non human registers for an account with the social networking system. Thereafter the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing for example a correct login ID or username and password. As used herein a user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.

When a user registers for an account with a social networking system the social networking system may create and store a record often referred to as a user profile in connection with the user. The user profile may include information provided by the user and information gathered by various systems including the social networking system relating to activities or actions of the user. For example the user may provide his name contact information birth date gender marital status family status employment education background preferences interests and other demographical information to be included in his user profile. The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user considers to be his friends. A list of the user s friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user s profile. Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction. For example if Bob and Joe are both users and connect with each another Bob and Joe are each connections of the other. If on the other hand Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam s posted content items but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob a one way connection may be formed where Sam is Bob s connection but Bob is not Sam s connection. Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections e.g. friends of friends . Connections may be added explicitly by a user for example the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users e.g. users who are alumni of the same educational institution . The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user s profile.

The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user such as contact information and interests at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time. The user may also update his or her profile information at any time. For example when the user moves or changes a phone number he may update his contact information. Additionally the user s interests may change as time passes and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time. A user s activities on the social networking system such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system may also provide information that may be included in the user s profile. Again such information may be updated from time to time to reflect the user s most recent activities. Still further other users or so called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user s profile. For example a contact may add the user as a friend or remove the user as a friend . A contact may also write messages to the user s profile pages typically known as wall posts. A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user s profile page.

A social network system may maintain social graph information which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds. A social network may be represented using a graph structure. Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network. Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users. In addition the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other. A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.

A social networking system may support a variety of applications such as photo sharing on line calendars and events. For example the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities. For example the social networking system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user s profile such as in a wall post or in a photo album both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system. Social networking system may also allow users to configure events. For example a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event location of the event and other users invited to the event. The invited users may receive invitations to the event and respond such as by accepting the invitation or declining it . Furthermore social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar. Similarly to events the calendar entries may include times dates locations and identities of other users.

The social networking system may also support a privacy model. A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third party applications or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third party applications. A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile. For example a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated with the user and or select settings that apply globally or to categories or types of user profile information. A privacy setting defines or identifies the set of entities e.g. other users connections of the user friends of friends or third party application that may have access to the user datum. The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity such as by specifying particular entities in the social network e.g. other users predefined groups of the user s connections a particular type of connections all of the user s connections all first degree connections of the user s connections the entire social network or even the entire Internet e.g. to make the posted content item index able and searchable on the Internet . A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted. Additionally a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.

A social networking system may support a news feed service. A news feed is a data format typically used for providing users with frequently updated content. A social networking system may provide various news feeds to its users where each news feed includes content relating to a specific subject matter or topic and or other users. Various pieces of content may be aggregated into a single news feed. In some implementations a social networking system may provide a news feed that includes selected entries corresponding to activities of a user s first degree contacts and or pages or topics that a user has indicated an interest. Individual users of the social networking system may subscribe to specific news feeds of their interest. U.S. Pat. No. 7 669 123 incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes describes a system that can be used to dynamically provide a news feed. A group of related actions may be presented together to a user of the social networking system in the same news feed. For example a news feed concerning the event organized through the social networking system may include information about the event such as its time location and attendees and photos taken at the event which have been uploaded to the social networking system. U.S. application Ser. No. 12 884 010 incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes describes a system that can be used to construct a news feed comprising related actions and present the news feed to a user of the social networking system.

Social networking system may maintain a database of information relating to geographic locations or places. Places may correspond to various physical locations such as restaurants bars train stations airports and the like. Some places may correspond to larger regions that themselves contain places such as a restaurant or a gate location in an airport. In one implementation each place can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social networking system as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 763 171 which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. Social networking system may allow users to access information regarding each place using a client application e.g. a browser hosted by a wired or wireless station such as a laptop desktop or mobile device. For example social networking system may serve web pages or other structured documents to users that request information about a place. In addition to user profile and place information the social networking system may track or maintain other information about the user. For example the social networking system may support geo social networking system functionality including one or more location based services that record the user s location. For example users may access the geo social networking system using a special purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user or a web or network based application using a browser client . The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System GPS or other geo location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user s current location to the geo social networking system. In addition the client application may support geo social networking functionality that allows users to check in at various locations and communicate this location to other users. A check in to a given place may occur when a user is physically located at a place and using a mobile device access the geo social networking system to register the user s presence at the place. As described below a user may select a place from a list of existing places near to the user s current location or create a new place. The user may also provide comments in a text string when checking in to a given place. The user may also identify one or more other users in connection with a check in such as friends of a user and associate them with the check in as well. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 574 614 which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes describes a system that allows a first user to check in other users at a given place. An entry including a comment and a time stamp corresponding to the time the user checked in may be displayed to other users. For example a record of the user s check in activity may be stored in a database. Social networking system may select one or more records associated with check in activities of users at a given place and include such check in activity in web pages or other structured documents that correspond to a given place. For example social networking system may select the check in activity associated with the friends or other social contacts of a user that requests a page corresponding to a place. U.S. application Ser. No. 12 858 718 incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes describes an example geo social networking system that can be used in connection with various embodiments of the present invention. The check in activity may also be displayed on a user profile page and in news feeds provided to users of the social networking system.

Additionally social networking system may provide various communication channels for users to interact with each other. Thus users of a social networking system may interact with each other by sending and receiving content items of various types of media through the communication channels. In particular embodiments communication channels may include but are not limited to email instant messaging IM text voice or video chat and wall posts. A user of the social networking system may also interact through various communication channels outside the social networking system with another person a user or non user of the social networking system . Examples of those communication channels are phone call though public switched telephone network PSTN or the Internet e.g. VOIP or voice over internet protocol video call text voice or video chat SMS short message service text messaging instant messaging and email. To keep track of communication channel information a user of the social networking system may keep one or more address books. An address book may contain one or more contacts e.g. a person or a business identify and for each contact communication channel information for the contact e.g. a phone number a user ID for an IM service an email address a user ID for a social networking system home address etc. . A user of the social networking system may keep the one or more address books inside or outside the social networking system. For example the social networking system may maintain an address book for a user and the user can access the address book though the social networking system s web site or through a client application hosted by a client device . For example a user may keep an address book in connection with a client application hosted locally by the user s personal computer e.g. Microsoft Outlook or keep an address book in a native address book application supported by the user s mobile phone. For example a user may keep an address book hosted over the Internet by a remote server i.e. the address book is hosted in the cloud and access the address book via a web browser on a client device .

In particular embodiments a user of the social networking system may upload one or more media files to media database . For example a user can upload a photo or a set of photos often called a photo album or a video clip to media database from a client device e.g. a computer or a camera phone . In particular embodiments the one or more media files may contain metadata often called tags associated with each media file. For example a photo shot by a digital camera may contain metadata relating to file size resolution time stamp name of the camera maker and or location e.g. GPS coordinates. A user can add additional metadata values to a photo or tag a photo during an upload process. Some examples of tags of a media file are author title comments event names time location names of people appearing in the media file or user comment. In particular embodiments a user may tag a media file by using a client application e.g. a photo or video editor or entering one or more tags in a graphical user interface of a media uploading tool that uploads a user s one or more media files from a client device to the social networking system. A user may also tag a media file after an upload at a later time in the social networking system s web site. In particular embodiments the social networking system may also extract metadata from a media file and store the metadata in media database .

In particular embodiments location database may store geo location data identifying a real world geographic location of a user associated with a check in. For example a geographic location of an Internet connected computer can be identified by the computer s IP address. For example a geographic location of a cell phone equipped with Wi Fi and GPS capabilities can be identified by cell tower triangulation Wi Fi positioning and or GPS positioning. In particular embodiments location database may store an information base of places where each place includes a name a geographic location and meta information. For example a place can be a local business a point of interest e.g. Union Square in San Francisco Calif. a college a city or a national park. For example a geographic location of a place e.g. a local coffee shop can be an address a set of geographic coordinates latitude and longitude or a reference to another place e.g. the coffee shop next to the train station . For example a geographic location of a place with a large area e.g. Yosemite National Park can be a shape e.g. a circle or a polygon approximating the boundary of the place and or a centroid i.e. geometric center of the shape. For example meta information of a place can include information identifying be the user that initially created the place reviews ratings comments check in activity data and the like. Places may be created by administrators of the system and or created by users of the system. For example a user may register a new place by accessing a client application to define a place name and provide a geographic location and cause the newly created place to be registered in location database . The creating user or other users may access a web page directed to the page and add additional information such as reviews comments and ratings for the place. In particular embodiments location database may store a user s location data. For example location database may store a user s check in activities. For example a user can create a place e.g. a new restaurant or coffee shop causing the social networking system to stores the user created place in location database . For example a user can create a comment a review or a rating of a place causing the social networking system to store the user s comment review and rating of the place in location database .

In particular embodiments news feed engine may access user profile database event database location database and media database for data about a user or set of users of the social networking system and assemble a list of one or more activities as news items for a particular user. In particular embodiments news feed engine may access privacy policy database and determine a subset of news items based on one or more privacy settings. In particular embodiments news feed engine may compile a dynamic list of a limited number of news items in a ranked or sorted order. In particular embodiments news feed engine may provide links related to one or more activities in the news items and links providing opportunities to participate in the activities. For example a news feed can comprise wall posts status updates comments and recent check ins to a place with a link to a web page of the place . In other embodiments news feed engine may access user profile database event database location database and media database and compile a dynamic list of a limited number of news items about a group of related actions received from users of the social networking system i.e. a news feed . For example a news feed can comprise an event that a user may schedule and organize through the social networking system with a link to participate the event check ins at a specific geographical location of the event by the user and other participants of the event messages about the event posted by the user and other participants of the event and photos of the event uploaded by the user and other participants of the event.

In particular embodiments user profile database may store communication channel information and an address book of a user. The address book in one implementation may be a superset or a subset of the users of the social networking system that a user has established a friend or contact relationship. A user of client device may access this address book information using a special purpose or general purpose client application to view contact information. In particular embodiments the address book may contain one or more contacts e.g. a person or an business entity and a name e.g. first name and or last name and communication channel information for each contact e.g. a phone number a user ID for an IM service an email address a user ID for a social networking system home address etc. . For at least a portion of the address book information the contact entries may be dynamic in that the contact entry is associated with a user of the social networking system that maintains his or her own account and corresponding user profile with contact information. Accordingly when a first user changes any aspect of contact information the revised contact information may be provided to requesting users. In particular embodiments a user may access the address book look up and connect to a contact through a communication channel. In some implementations the client device may maintain a local copy of the address book that may be refreshed or synchronized at various times.

Caller identification or caller ID is a telephone service available in analog and digital phone systems and in most VoIP applications that transmits a caller s phone number to a receiving party s telephony equipment e.g. a mobile phone . When a person receives an incoming call on his phone from a caller the phone can display the caller s phone number if caller ID service is available. illustrates an example of a mobile phone interface displaying an incoming phone number. Additionally if the caller s phone number and a corresponding name are available in a local address book on the phone the phone can display the corresponding name in addition to the phone number. Particular embodiments herein describe methods of displaying a caller s name and related information such as status information location degree of separation common friends and the like based on data stored in a social networking system. In some implementations calling user information may be made available and displayed to the called user even if the calling user s phone number is not available locally on a receiver s phone prior to the incoming call.

In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may access one or more data stores for information associated with the user identifier or the calling user . In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may access user profile database for user profile information of the calling user. For example the social caller identification process can access user profile database for a name and a profile picture for the calling user. For example the social caller identification process can access user profile database for affiliation information of the calling user e.g. married to employer etc. For example the social caller identification process can access user profile database for social graph information e.g. a degree of separation between the calling and called user mutual friends between the calling user and the receiving user etc. In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may access location database for location data of the calling user e.g. a recent check in to a place or GPS location . In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may cause news feed engine to access user profile database event database privacy policy database location database and media database to compile a mini news feed about the calling user. The social caller identification process may also access the social networking system to retrieve a current status message posted by the calling user to the social networking system. In some implementations the social caller identification process may transmit a generic request for social network information of the calling user allowing the social networking system to choose all or part of the information returned in a response to the request.

In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may present to the receiving user the information associated with the user identifier or the calling user in connection with a notification of the incoming call. illustrates an example of a mobile phone displaying a name location data and social graph information associated with an incoming call. In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may construct a frame containing information associated with the user identifier of the calling user. In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may display the frame overlaying a user interface of the receiving user s client device . For example a caller identification query function can be implemented as part of a special purpose client application in the receiving user s mobile phone or as part of library bundled with the operating system of the receiving user s mobile phone an incoming call with a calling number can cause a call to the caller identification query function e.g. FBuserIDquery facebook.com php caller 6505551212 to access one or more data stores of the social networking system and obtain the calling user s information in a structured document e.g. in HTML or in JAVASCRIPT and the caller identification query function can display the frame overlaying the mobile phone s user interface or overlaying a user interface of an application the receiving user is using while the incoming call occurs. illustrates an example of a mobile phone displaying a frame containing information associated with a calling user. In this manner a called user may view social graph information of the calling user such as the number of friends in common or a status or location of the user as a call is coming in. The called user can use this information in part to decide for example whether to receive the call or let it proceed to voice mail. illustrates another example of a mobile phone displaying a frame containing information associated with a calling user. In the example of the calling user is a first degree contact of the receiving user and the caller identification query function can access one or more database and construct the frame displaying wall posts of the calling user i.e. the calling user s wall .

In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may access one or more data stores for information associated with the user identifier or the calling user and present the information to the receiving user based on one or more privacy settings by the calling user. For example if the calling user marks the phone number for the call to the receiving user as private i.e. not accessible to other users in the social networking system then the social networking system will not allow the social caller identification process to obtain and present information about the calling user including the calling user s name to the receiving user. For example if the calling user marks the phone number for the call to the receiving user as private the social caller identification process can obtain information about the calling user based on the phone number and present to the receiving user the calling user s information except the phone number e.g. presenting a name a news feed and a location . For example if the calling user marks GPS location as private then the social networking system will not allow the social caller identification process to obtain and present the calling user s current location to the receiving user.

In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may access one or more data stores for information associated with one or more users and cache all or a subset of the information associated with one ore more users in one or more computing devices. For example the social caller identification process can access user profile database for profile pictures of a user s first degree friends store the first degree friends profile pictures in the user s laptop computer for later user and periodically update the stored profile pictures of the first degree friends. For example the social caller identification process can store cache information associated with a frequent caller to a first user in the first user s mobile phone for later use. In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may present to a receiving user information associated with a caller based on the stored information. For example if John calls Bob on Bob s mobile phone when the social networking system is unavailable the social caller identification process can display John s information on Bob s mobile phone based on John s information stored in Bob s mobile phone.

As a user s client device can receive communication requests via communication channels other than phone calls e.g. instant messaging chat the social caller identification process can determine a requester s user identifier based on a user ID of a communication channel e.g. a user ID of a instant messaging service . In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may receive a communication request from an originator to a receiving user by a particular communication channel with the originator s user ID for the particular communication channel accessing a data store to determine the originator s user identifier of the social networking system based on the user ID for the particular communication channel accessing one or more data stores for information of the originator based on the user identifier and present the information of the originator to the receiving user. For example a SMS message can be treated in a similar manner to phone calls in that user profile information of the sender of the SMS message can be displayed in connection with the message itself or a notification of the message.

Additionally the example method illustrated in can also be used when a user retrieves communication records of various communication channels for example when a user browses call logs or accesses a voice mail or a saved instant message. In particular embodiments the social caller identification process may receive a request from a user to retrieve a communication record from an originator access a data store to determine a user identifier of the social networking system for the originator based on the originator s user ID associated with the communication record access one or more data stores for information of the originator based on the user identifier and present the information of the originator to the user. For example when a user accessing a saved text message from a sender user profile information of the sender can be displayed in connection with the saved text message itself.
