title: Non-invasive treatment of neurodegenerative diseases
abstract: Methods and devices for the non-invasive treatment of neurodegenerative diseases through delivery of energy to target nervous tissue, particularly the vagus nerve. In certain embodiments, the devices include a magnetic stimulator having coils with toroidal windings, which are in contact with an electrically conducting medium that is adapted to conform to the contour of a target body surface of a patient. The coils induce an electric current and/or an electric field within the patient, thereby stimulating nerve fibers within the patient. The stimulation brings about reduction of neuroinflammation in patients suffering from conditions comprising Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, postoperative cognitive dysfunction and postoperative delirium.

The field of the present invention relates to the delivery of energy impulses and or fields to bodily tissues for therapeutic purposes. It relates more specifically to the use of non invasive methods and devices particularly methods that make use of magnetic stimulation devices to treat neurodegenerative disorders using energy that is delivered by such devices. The medical disorders include Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease multiple sclerosis postoperative cognitive dysfunction and postoperative delirium. The treatment relates to stimulation of the vagus nerve to reduce neuro inflammation wherein pathways involving anti inflammatory cytokines the retinoic acid signaling system and or neurotrophic factors are enhanced and or pathways involving pro inflammatory cytokines are inhibited.

Treatments for various infirmities sometime require the destruction of otherwise healthy tissue in order to produce a beneficial effect. Malfunctioning tissue is identified and then lesioned or otherwise compromised in order to produce a beneficial outcome rather than attempting to repair the tissue to its normal functionality. A variety of techniques and mechanisms have been designed to produce focused lesions directly in target nerve tissue but collateral damage is inevitable.

Other treatments for malfunctioning tissue can be medicinal in nature but in many cases the patients become dependent upon artificially synthesized chemicals. In many cases these medicinal approaches have side effects that are either unknown or quite significant. Unfortunately the beneficial outcomes of surgery and medicines are often realized at the cost of function of other tissues or risks of side effects.

The use of electrical stimulation for treatment of medical conditions has been well known in the art for nearly two thousand years. It has been recognized that electrical stimulation of the brain and or the peripheral nervous system and or direct stimulation of the malfunctioning tissue holds significant promise for the treatment of many ailments because such stimulation is generally a wholly reversible and non destructive treatment.

Nerve stimulation is thought to be accomplished directly or indirectly by depolarizing a nerve membrane causing the discharge of an action potential or by hyperpolarization of a nerve membrane preventing the discharge of an action potential. Such stimulation may occur after electrical energy or also other forms of energy are transmitted to the vicinity of a nerve F. RATTAY. The basic mechanism for the electrical stimulation of the nervous system. Neuroscience Vol. 89 No. 2 pp. 335 346 1999 Thomas HEIMBURG and Andrew D. Jackson. On soliton propagation in biomembranes and nerves. PNAS vol. 102 no. 28 Jul. 12 2005 9790 9795 . Nerve stimulation may be measured directly as an increase decrease or modulation of the activity of nerve fibers or it may be inferred from the physiological effects that follow the transmission of energy to the nerve fibers.

Electrical stimulation of the brain with implanted electrodes has been approved for use in the treatment of various conditions including movement disorders such as essential tremor and Parkinson s disease. The principle underlying these approaches involves disruption and modulation of hyperactive neuronal circuit transmission at specific sites in the brain. Unlike potentially dangerous lesioning procedures in which aberrant portions of the brain are physically destroyed electrical stimulation is achieved by implanting electrodes at these sites. The electrodes are used first to sense aberrant electrical signals and then to send electrical pulses to locally disrupt pathological neuronal transmission driving it back into the normal range of activity. These electrical stimulation procedures while invasive are generally conducted with the patient conscious and a participant in the surgery.

Brain stimulation and deep brain stimulation in particular is not without some drawbacks. The procedure requires penetrating the skull and inserting an electrode into brain matter using a catheter shaped lead or the like. While monitoring the patient s condition such as tremor activity etc. the position of the electrode is adjusted to achieve significant therapeutic potential. Next adjustments are made to the electrical stimulus signals such as frequency periodicity voltage current etc. again to achieve therapeutic results. The electrode is then permanently implanted and wires are directed from the electrode to the site of a surgically implanted pacemaker. The pacemaker provides the electrical stimulus signals to the electrode to maintain the therapeutic effect. While the therapeutic results of deep brain stimulation are promising there are significant complications that arise from the implantation procedure including stroke induced by damage to surrounding tissues and the neuro vasculature.

One of the most successful applications of modern understanding of the electrophysiological relationship between muscle and nerves is the cardiac pacemaker. Although origins of the cardiac pacemaker extend back into the 1800 s it was not until 1950 that the first practical albeit external and bulky pacemaker was developed. The first truly functional wearable pacemaker appeared in 1957 and in 1960 the first fully implantable pacemaker was developed.

Around this time it was also found that electrical leads could be connected to the heart through veins which eliminated the need to open the chest cavity and attach the lead to the heart wall. In 1975 the introduction of the lithium iodide battery prolonged the battery life of a pacemaker from a few months to more than a decade. The modern pacemaker can treat a variety of different signaling pathologies in the cardiac muscle and can serve as a defibrillator as well see U.S. Pat. No. 6 738 667 to DENO et al. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference .

Another application of electrical stimulation of nerves has been the treatment of radiating pain in the lower extremities by stimulating the sacral nerve roots at the bottom of the spinal cord see U.S. Pat. No. 6 871 099 to WHITEHURST et al. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference .

Yet another application of electrical stimulation of nerves has been the treatment of epilepsy and depression by vagus nerve stimulation VNS U.S. Pat. No. 4 702 254 entitled Neurocybernetic prosthesis to ZABARA U.S. Pat. No. 6 341 236 entitled Vagal nerve stimulation techniques for treatment of epileptic seizures to OSORIO et al U.S. Pat. No. 5 299 569 entitled Treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders by nerve stimulation to WERNICKE et al . For this procedure the left vagus nerve is ordinarily stimulated at a location on the neck by first implanting an electrode there then connecting the electrode to an electrical stimulator.

Despite the clinical success of VNS in treating epilepsy and depression a specific mechanism underlying VNS relief of symptoms is not currently known. Vagus afferent fibers innervate several medullary structures with the nucleus of the tractus solitarius NTS receiving bilateral inputs totaling approximately eighty percent of all vagal afferents. The NTS has widespread projections including direct or multiple synaptic projections to the parabrachial nucleus vermis inferior cerebellar hemispheres raphe nuclei periaquaductal gray locus coeruleus thalamus hypothalamus amygdala nucleus accumbens anterior insula infralimbic cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex making it difficult to determine the area or neuronal pathway mediating VNS effects. However functional imaging studies have concluded that VNS may bring about changes in several areas of the brain including the thalamus cerebellum orbitofrontal cortex limbic system hypothalamus and medulla. The stimulation of particular areas of the brain has been suggested as a mechanism for the effects of VNS but such localized stimulation of the brain may depend upon the parameters of the stimulation current frequency pulse width duty cycle etc. . Those parameters may also determine which neurotransmitters are modulated including norepinephrine seratonin and GABA Mark S. George Ziad Nahas Daryl E. Bohning Qiwen Mu F.

To date the selection of stimulation parameters for VNS has been highly empirical in which the parameters are varied about some initially successful set of parameters in an effort to find an improved set of parameters for each patient. A more efficient approach to selecting stimulation parameters might be to select a stimulation waveform that mimics electrical activity in the region of the brain that one is attempting to stimulate in an effort to entrain the naturally occurring electrical waveform as suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 6 234 953 entitled Electrotherapy device using low frequency magnetic pulses to THOMAS et al. and application number US20090299435 entitled Systems and methods for enhancing or affecting neural stimulation efficiency and or efficacy to GLINER et al.

The present disclosure involves devices and medical procedures that stimulate nerves by transmitting energy to nerves and tissue non invasively. A medical procedure is defined as being non invasive when no break in the skin or other surface of the body such as a wound bed is created through use of the method and when there is no contact with an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice e.g. beyond the mouth or beyond the external auditory meatus of the ear . Such non invasive procedures are distinguished from invasive procedures including minimally invasive procedures in that invasive procedures do involve inserting a substance or device into or through the skin or into an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice.

Potential advantages of such non invasive medical methods and devices relative to comparable invasive procedures are as follows. The patient may be more psychologically prepared to experience a procedure that is non invasive and may therefore be more cooperative resulting in a better outcome. Non invasive procedures may avoid damage of biological tissues such as that due to bleeding infection skin or internal organ injury blood vessel injury and vein or lung blood clotting. Non invasive procedures are sometimes painless or only minimally painful and may be performed without the need for even local anesthesia. Less training may be required for use of non invasive procedures by medical professionals. In view of the reduced risk ordinarily associated with non invasive procedures some such procedures may be suitable for use by the patient or family members at home or by first responders at home or at a workplace and the cost of non invasive procedures may be reduced relative to comparable invasive procedures.

For example transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS is non invasive because it involves attaching electrodes to the surface of the skin or using a form fitting conductive garment without breaking the skin. In contrast percutaneous electrical stimulation of a nerve is minimally invasive because it involves the introduction of an electrode under the skin via needle puncture of the skin. Both TENS and percutaneous electrical stimulation can be to some extent unpleasant or painful in the experience of patients that undergo such procedures. In the case of TENS as the depth of penetration of the stimulus under the skin is increased any pain will generally begin or increase.

Neurodegenerative diseases result from the deterioration of neurons causing brain dysfunction. The diseases are loosely divided into two groups conditions affecting memory that are ordinarily related to dementia and conditions causing problems with movements. The most widely known neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer or Alzheimer s disease and its precursor mild cognitive impairment MCI Parkinson s disease including Parkinson s disease dementia and multiple sclerosis.

Less well known neurodegenerative diseases include adrenoleukodystrophy AIDS dementia complex Alexander disease Alper s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS ataxia telangiectasia Batten disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy Canavan disease cerebral amyloid angiopathy cerebellar ataxia Cockayne syndrome corticobasal degeneration Creutzfeldt Jakob disease diffuse myelinoclastic sclerosis fatal familial insomnia Fazio Londe disease Friedreich s ataxia frontotemporal dementia or lobar degeneration hereditary spastic paraplegia Huntington disease Kennedy s disease Krabbe disease Lewy body dementia Lyme disease Machado Joseph disease motor neuron disease Multiple systems atrophy neuroacanthocytosis Niemann Pick disease Pelizaeus Merzbacher Disease Pick s disease primary lateral sclerosis including its juvenile form progressive bulbar palsy progressive supranuclear palsy Refsum s disease including its infantile form Sandhoff disease Schilder s disease spinal muscular atrophy spinocerebellar ataxia Steele Richardson Olszewski disease subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord survival motor neuron spinal muscular atrophy Tabes dorsalis Tay Sachs disease toxic encephalopathy transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Vascular dementia and X linked spinal muscular atrophy as well as idiopathic or cryptogenic diseases as follows synucleinopathy progranulinopathy tauopathy amyloid disease prion disease protein aggregation disease and movement disorder. A more comprehensive listing may be found at the web site www of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ninds of the National Institutes of Health nih of the United States government gov in a subdirectory disorder disorder index web page htm . It is understood that such diseases often go by more than one name and that a nosology may oversimplify pathologies that occur in combination or that are not archetypical.

Certain other disorders such as postoperative cognitive dysfunction have been described only recently and they too may involve neuro degeneration. Other disorders such as epilepsy may not be primarily neurodegenerative but at some point in their progression they might involve nerve degeneration.

Despite the fact that at least some aspect of the pathology of each of the neurodegenerative diseases mentioned above is different from the other diseases their pathologies ordinarily share other features so that they may be considered as a group. Furthermore aspects of their pathologies that they have in common often make it possible to treat them with similar therapeutic methods. Thus many publications describe features that neurodegenerative diseases have in common Dale E. Bredesen Rammohan V. Rao and Patrick Mehlen. Cell death in the nervous system.

One such common feature is the presence of inflammation wherein the body recognizes the abnormality of the relevant neuronal tissue and responds to minimize or repair the effects of the abnormality and or eventually destroy the abnormal tissue.

The brain as a target of inflammation common pathways link inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Trends in Neurosciences 29 9 2006 518 527 . It is understood that inflammation may accompany not only neurodegenerative disease but also brain injury that is caused for example by trauma stroke or infection. Consequently the methods that are disclosed herein may also be applicable to any situation in which inflammation in the central nervous system presents a danger to the patient.

Because excessive and prolonged inflammation may destroy nervous tissue that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases therapies have been proposed to prevent reduce or eliminate the immune response in such inflammation or to repair damage that may have been produced by inflammation. Inflammation is modulated by cytokines which are small cell signaling protein or peptide molecules that are secreted by glial cells of the nervous system by numerous cells of the immune system and by many other cell types. Some cytokines may regarded as hormones but in what follows the term cytokine is used to refer to any of those immuno modulating molecules with the understanding that they may also participate in pathways other than immunomodulation.

In general one may adopt two approaches to reduce or prevent inflammation that is modulated by cytokines. First one may attempt to inhibit the release or effectiveness of cytokines that promote inflammation. Those cytokines are called pro inflammatory and the first approach is essentially an anti pro inflammatory strategy. Because pro inflammatory cytokines may promote the release of other pro inflammatory cytokines the goal is especially to inhibit the release of the initially released pro inflammatory cytokines in an inflammatory cascade. For example the cytokine tumor necrosis factor TNF alpha is considered to be a pro inflammatory cytokine of central importance and anti TNF alpha strategies seek to inhibit the release or effectiveness of TNF alpha that is released from immune and other cells Ian A. Clark Lisa M. Alleva Bryce Vissel. The roles of TNF in brain dysfunction and disease. Pharmacology Therapeutics 128 2010 519 548 Melissa K McCoy and Mali G Tansey. TNF signaling inhibition in the CNS implications for normal brain function and neurodegenerative disease. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2008 5 45 .

A second approach to reducing inflammation that is modulated by cytokines is to enhance and or stimulate the release or effectiveness of cytokines that inhibit inflammation. Those cytokines are called anti inflammatory and the second approach is essentially a pro anti inflammatory strategy. As indicated below pro anti inflammatory mechanisms are often associated with the repair of tissue which may correspond in the adult to mechanisms that were used in the embryo to create tissue originally. The cytokine transforming growth factor beta TGF beta is often regarded as anti inflammatory but as described presently its anti inflammatory capabilities are contingent upon certain conditions being met. According to the second approach one endeavors to promote such conditions as well as to promote the release of for example TGF beta into a potentially inflammatory environment.

In a series of publications patents and patent applications Kevin J. TRACEY and colleagues described electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in an attempt to effect the first anti pro inflammatory strategy Kevin J. Tracey. The inflammatory reflex. Nature 420 2002 853 859 Kevin J. Tracey. Physiology and immunology of the cholinergic anti inflammatory pathway. J. Clin. Invest. 117 2007 289 296 Kevin 1 Tracey. Understanding immunity requires more than immunology. Nature Immunology 11 2010 561 564 G. R. Johnston and N. R. Webster. Cytokines and the immunomodulatory function of the vagus nerve. British Journal of Anaesthesia 102 April 2009 453 462 . U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 610 713 and 6 838 471 entitled Inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production by cholinergic agonists and vagus nerve stimulation to TRACEY mention treatment of neurodegenerative diseases within a long list of diseases in connection with the treatment of inflammation through stimulation of the vagus nerve. According to those patents Inflammation and other deleterious conditions . . . are often induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor TNF also known as TNF.alpha. or cachectin . . . The patents go on to state that Proinflammatory cytokines are to be distinguished from anti inflammatory cytokines . . . which are not mediators of inflammation. It is clear from those patents that the objective of TRACEY and colleagues is only to suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha. There is no mention or suggestion that the method is intended to modulate the activity of anti inflammatory cytokines and in fact the text quoted above disclaims a role for anti inflammatory cytokines as mediators of inflammation. Those patents and applications make a generally unjustified dichotomy between pro and anti inflammatory cytokines by suggesting that a cytokine could be one or the other but not both. In particular the patents make no mention of the cytokine TGF beta and there is no suggestion that the role of a cytokine in regards to its pro or anti inflammation competence may be inherently indeterminate or indefinite unless more information is provided about the presumed physiological environment in which the cytokine finds itself.

Treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is also mentioned within long lists of diseases in the following related applications to TRACEY and his colleague HUSTON wherein stimulation of the vagus nerve is intended to suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha US20060178703 entitled Treating inflammatory disorders by electrical vagus nerve stimulation to HUSTON et al.

The present invention discloses methods and devices for the non invasive treatment of neurodegenerative conditions utilizing an energy source that transmits energy non invasively to nervous tissue. In particular the devices can transmit energy to or in close proximity to a vagus nerve of the patient in order to temporarily stimulate block and or modulate electrophysiological signals in that nerve. The neurodegenerative conditions disorders or diseases that can be treated with the present invention include Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease multiple sclerosis postoperative cognitive dysfunction or postoperative delirium.

In one aspect of the invention a method for treating a neurodegenerative disorder in a patient comprises applying energy transcustaneously through an outer skin surface of the patient to generate an electrical impulse at or near a selected nerve such as the vagus nerve within the patient. The electrical impulse is sufficient to inhibit inflammation in the patient and treat the neurodegenerative disorder. In some embodiments the electrical impulse is sufficient to inhibit and or block the release of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha. In other embodiments the electrical impulse is sufficient to increase the anti inflammatory competence of certain cytokines to thereby offset or reduce the effect of pro inflammatory cytokines.

In one embodiment an electrical current is transcutaneously applied through the outer skin surface of the patient to the vagus nerve. In another embodiment a magnetic field is generated exterior to the patient that is sufficient to induce an electrical impulse at or near the selected nerve e.g. the vagus nerve within the patient.

In a preferred embodiment a time varying magnetic field is generated within an enclosed coil outside of the patient that induces an electrical field. The electrical field is shaped such that an electrical current is conducted through the outer skin surface of the patient to modulate the selected nerve. The electrical field may be shaped by generating a second time varying magnetic field within a second enclosed coil positioned near or adjacent to the first enclosed coil. In other embodiments the electrical field may be shaped by positioning a conducting medium around a portion of the enclosed coil such that the direction of the electrical field is constrained within the conducting medium.

In another aspect of the invention an apparatus for applying energy transcutaneously to a target region within a patient with a neurodegenerative disorder is provided. The apparatus includes a source of energy for generating an energy field that is located essentially entirely exterior to an outer skin surface of the patient. The energy field is sufficient to transcutaneously pass through the outer skin surface and generate an electrical impulse at or near the target region. The electrical impulse modulates activity of a selected nerve at the target region to inhibit inflammation in the patient and treat the neurodegenerative disorder. The apparatus preferably also includes a conduction medium that electrically couples the electric field with the outer skin surface to facilitate passage of the electric current therethrough.

In an exemplary embodiment a magnetic stimulator is used to modulate electrical activity of the vagus nerve. The stimulator comprises a source of electrical power a magnetically permeable toroidal core and a coil that is wound around the core. The device also comprises a continuous electrically conducting medium with which the coil and core are in contact wherein the conducting medium has a shape that conforms to the contour of a target body surface of a patient when the medium is applied to the target body surface. For the present medical applications the device is ordinarily applied to the patient s neck. The source of power supplies a pulse of electric charge to the coil such that the coil induces an electric current and or an electric field within the patient. The stimulator is configured to induce a peak pulse voltage sufficient to produce an electric field in the vicinity of a nerve such as the vagus to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation. By way of example the threshold electric field for stimulation of nerve terminals may be about 8 V m at 1000 Hz. For example the device may induce an electric field within the patient of about 10 to 600 V m and an electrical field with a gradient of greater than 2 V m mm.

The preferred magnetic stimulator comprises two toroidal coils and corresponding cores that lie side by side each containing a high permeability material wherein current passing through a coil produces a magnetic field within the core of about 0.1 to 2 Tesla. Current passing through a coil may be about 0.5 to 20 amperes typically 2 amperes with voltages across each coil of 10 to 100 volts. The current is passed through the coils in bursts of pulses. The burst repeats at 1 Hz to 5000 Hz preferably at 15 50 Hz. The pulses have duration of 20 to 1000 microseconds preferably 200 microseconds and there may be 1 to 20 pulses per burst. The preferred magnetic stimulator shapes an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to a long nerve such as the vagus nerve.

By selecting a suitable waveform to stimulate the nerve the magnetic stimulator produces a correspondingly selective physiological response in an individual patient. In general the induced electrical signal has a frequency between about 1 Hz to 3000 Hz and a pulse duration of between about 10 1000 microseconds. By way of example at least one induced electrical signal may be of a frequency between about 15 Hz to 35 Hz. By way of example at least one induced electrical signal may have a pulsed on time of between about 50 to 1000 microseconds such as between about 100 to 300 microseconds. The induced electrical signal may have any desired waveform which may comprise one or more of a full or partial sinusoid a square wave a rectangular wave and triangle wave.

Teachings of the present invention demonstrate how non invasive stimulators may be positioned and used against body surfaces particularly at a location on the patient s neck under which the vagus nerve is situated. Those teachings also provide methods for treatment of particular neurodegenerative diseases that involve neurodegeneration neuroinflammation or inflammation more generally. However it should be understood that application of the methods and devices is not limited to the examples that are given.

Stimulation of the vagus nerve with the magnetic stimulator brings about reduction of neuroinflammation in patients suffering from conditions comprising Alzheimer s Disease Parkinson s Disease Multiple Sclerosis postoperative cognitive dysfunction and postoperative delirium. The reduction in inflammation is effected by enhancing the anti inflammatory competence of cytokines such as TGF beta wherein a retinoid or components of the retinoic acid signaling system provide an anti inflammatory bias by enhancing anti inflammatory activity of a neurotrophic factor such as NGF GDNF BDNF or MANE and or by inhibiting the activity of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha.

The novel systems devices and methods for treating medical conditions using the disclosed magnetic stimulator or other non invasive stimulation devices are more completely described in the following detailed description of the invention with reference to the drawings provided herewith and in claims appended hereto. Other aspects features advantages etc. will become apparent to one skilled in the art when the description of the invention herein is taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Hereby all issued patents published patent applications and non patent publications that are mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes to the same extent as if each individual issued patent published patent application or non patent publication were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.

In the present invention energy is transmitted non invasively to a patient. In one of the preferred embodiments a time varying magnetic field originating outside of a patient is generated such that the magnetic field induces an electromagnetic field and or eddy currents within tissue of the patient. The invention is particularly useful for inducing applied electrical impulses that interact with the signals of one or more nerves or muscles to achieve a therapeutic result. In particular the present disclosure describes devices and methods to treat neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease multiple sclerosis postoperative cognitive dysfunction and postoperative delirium.

In an exemplary embodiment the present invention includes methods and devices for inducing by a time varying magnetic field electrical fields and current within tissue in accordance with Faraday s law of induction. Magnetic stimulation is non invasive because the magnetic field is produced by passing a time varying current through a coil positioned outside the body inducing at a distance an electric field and electric current within electrically conducting bodily tissue. Because the induced electric field and induced current depend not only upon current being passed through wire of the coil but also upon the permeability of core material around which the coil may be wound the term coil as used herein refers not only to the current carrying wire but also to the core material unless otherwise indicated. Large pulsed magnetic fields PMF can induce significant electric fields in conducting media including human tissue. Particular waveforms and amplitudes can stimulate action potentials in nerves both in vitro and in vivo. Due to the noninvasive nature of the stimulation PMF devices have found utility in several clinical applications both therapeutically e.g. for treating depression via transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS and diagnostically for peripheral nerve stimulation. It is an objective of the present invention to use magnetic stimulation to produce significantly less pain or discomfort as compared with that experienced by the patient undergoing a treatment with TENS for a given depth of stimulus penetration. Or conversely for a given amount of pain or discomfort on the part of the patient e.g. the threshold at which such discomfort or pain begins an objective of the present invention is to achieve a greater depth of penetration of the stimulus under the skin.

The principle of operation of magnetic stimulation along with a description of commercially available equipment and a list of medical applications of magnetic stimulation is reviewed in Chris HOVEY and Reza Jalinous The Guide to Magnetic Stimulation The Magstim Company Ltd Spring Gardens Whitland Carmarthenshire SA34 0HR United Kingdom 2006.

As described in the above cited publications the circuits for magnetic stimulators are generally complex and expensive. They use a high current impulse generator that may produce discharge currents of 5 000 amps or more which is passed through the stimulator coil and which thereby produces a magnetic pulse. Typically a transformer charges a capacitor in the impulse generator which also contains circuit elements that limit the effect of undesirable electrical transients. Charging of the capacitor is under the control of a control unit which accepts information such as the capacitor voltage power and other parameters set by the user as well as from various safety interlocks within the equipment that ensure proper operation and the capacitor is then discharged through the coil via an electronic switch e.g. a controlled rectifier when the user wishes to apply the stimulus. Greater flexibility is obtained by adding to the impulse generator a bank of capacitors that can be discharged at different times. Thus higher impulse rates may be achieved by discharging capacitors in the bank sequentially such that recharging of capacitors is performed while other capacitors in the bank are being discharged. Furthermore by discharging some capacitors while the discharge of other capacitors is in progress by discharging the capacitors through resistors having variable resistance and by controlling the polarity of the discharge the control unit may synthesize pulse shapes that approximate an arbitrary function.

In the preferred embodiments of the present invention the disclosed methods use a magnetic stimulation device that requires significantly less electrical current to be passed through its coil s than magnetic stimulation devices currently known in the art. That low current magnetic stimulation device also has control circuits impulse generators and power supplies that are significantly less complex than magnetic stimulation devices currently known in the art. In fact the magnetic stimulation device used in preferred embodiments of the present invention requires so little power that it can be operated using conventional low voltage batteries thereby reducing the cost to manufacture the device and allowing for portability of the device. The low current magnetic stimulation device was disclosed in Applicant s co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 964 050 entitled Magnetic Stimulation Devices and Methods of Therapy to SIMON et al which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

A practical disadvantage of conventional magnetic stimulator coils is that they overheat when used over an extended period of time because large coil currents are required to reach threshold electric fields in the stimulated tissue. At high repetition rates currents can heat the coils to unacceptable levels in seconds to minutes depending on the power levels and pulse durations and rates. Accordingly coil cooling equipment is used which adds complexity to the magnetic stimulator coils. Two approaches to overcome heating are to cool the coils with flowing water or air or to increase the magnetic fields using ferrite cores thus allowing smaller currents . For some applications where relatively long treatment times at high stimulation frequencies may be required e.g. treating asthma by stimulating the vagus nerve neither of these two approaches may be adequate. Water cooled coils overheat in a few minutes. Ferrite core coils heat more slowly due to the lower currents and heat capacity of the ferrite core but they also cool slowly and do not allow for water cooling because the ferrite core occupies the volume where the cooling water would flow. One solution to this problem is to use a core that contains ferrofluids U.S. Pat. No. 7 396 326 and published applications US20080114199 US20080177128 and US20080224808 all entitled Ferrofluid cooling and acoustical noise reduction in magnetic stimulators respectively to GHIRON et al. RIEHL et al. RIEHL et al. and GHIRON et al. . However even the use of ferrofluids may be inadequate when long treatment times at high stimulation frequencies may be required.

In preferred embodiments of the present invention applicant s above mentioned low current magnetic stimulation device is used which requires so little electrical current to be passed through its coil s that no special cooling apparatus is required to operate the device. That device may therefore be operated at high repetition rates for an indefinite period of time. In other embodiments or the present invention higher current magnetic stimulation coils are used which may be cooled using methods and devices that Applicant disclosed in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 859 568 entitled Non invasive Treatment of Bronchial Constriction to SIMON which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. That application also disclosed methods and devices for the stimulation of nerves other than magnetic stimulation devices and methods including mechanical and or acoustical optical and or thermal and electrode based electrical methods and devices each of which may be used in alternate embodiments of the present invention in lieu of or in addition to the preferred magnetic stimulation devices and methods.

Another problem that is sometimes encountered during magnetic stimulation is the unpleasantness or pain that is experienced by the patient in the vicinity of the stimulated tissue. Little is known about the mechanism that produces the pain although it is generally recognized that magnetic stimulation produces less pain than its electrode based counterpart. Most investigations that address this question examine pain associated with transcranial stimulation.

ANDERSON et al found that when magnetic stimulation is repeated over the course of multiple sessions the patients adapt to the pain and exhibit progressively less discomfort Berry S.

No. 7 614 996 entitled Reducing discomfort caused by electrical stimulation to RIEHL discloses the application of a secondary stimulus to counteract what would otherwise be an uncomfortable primary stimulus.

However these methods of reducing pain or discomfort on the part of the stimulated patient are not always successful or practical. Accordingly in the preferred embodiments of the present invention applicant s above mentioned low current magnetic stimulation device is used which produces significantly less pain or discomfort if any to the patient than magnetic stimulator devices that are currently known in the art.

To achieve the objectives of the present invention applicant s above mentioned low current magnetic stimulation device uses an efficient method to produce electric fields in tissue noninvasively namely to use a toroidal winding around a high magnetic permeability material core embedded in a conducting medium Rafael CARBUNARU and Dominique M. Durand. Toroidal coil models for transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of nerves. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. 48 No. 4 April 2001 434 441 . The conducting medium must have direct contact with skin for current to flow from the coil into the tissue. In essence Applicant s device produces a transcutaneous current similar to a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS device but with greater depth of penetration and virtually no unpleasant peripheral nerve stimulation. In addition to generate electric fields equivalent to other PMF devices toroidal stimulators require only about 0.001 0.1 of the current and produce virtually no heating. It is understood that the magnetic field of a toroidal magnetic stimulator remains essentially within the toroid and that when referring to this device as a magnetic stimulator it is in fact the electric fields and or currents that are induced outside the stimulator that produce an effect in the patient not the magnetic field.

To the applicant s knowledge no significant development of toroidal coil magnetic stimulators has taken place beyond what was reported in the above mentioned CARBUNARU and Durand publication and the dissertation upon which it was based Rafael Carbunaru FAIERSTEIN Coil Designs for Localized and Efficient Magnetic Stimulation of the Nervous System. Ph.D. Dissertation Department of Biomedical Engineering Case Western Reserve May 1999. UMI Microform Number 9940153 UMI Company Ann Arbor Mich. . Toroidal coils or partial toroids were mentioned in the following patents or patent applications but they did not develop the use of a conducting medium in contact with skin US20080027513 entitled Systems And Methods For Using A Butterfly Coil To Communicate With Or Transfer Power To An Implantable Medical Device to CARBUNARU U.S. Pat.

The latter application to BURNETT et al. only notes that in the paper titled Contactless Nerve Stimulation and Signal Detection by Inductive Transducer presented at the 1969 Symposium on Application of Magnetism in Bioengineering Maass et al. disclosed that a nerve threading the lumen of a toroid could be stimulated by a magnetic field. 

The lack of development is apparently due to the difficulty of embedding the coil in a practical conducting medium and having that medium be safely in direct contact with human skin. The only reported toroidal coil magnetic stimulation device used to stimulate human nerves was described in the above cited dissertation by Rafael Carbunaru FAIERSTEIN and it embedded the coil in agar. Agar degrades in time and is not ideal to use against skin presenting difficulties with cleaning it from a patient and within a device. Furthermore as disclosed there the toroid needs to be surrounded by conducting medium above below and around it making for a relatively bulky device that is difficult to apply to target tissue having small cross sectional area. Furthermore the device that FAIERSTEIN discloses cannot be applied to the surface of the skin at an arbitrary orientation.

In preferred embodiments of the present invention Applicant s low current toroidal coil magnetic stimulation device is used. The device may be applied to body surfaces having an arbitrary orientation with respect to the long axis of the component containing the coil. Additional advantages of embodiments of Applicant s device are that the embodiments are compact and portable and that they may be adapted for use in nerve and tissue stimulation applications that treat diverse medical conditions. Applicant s co pending patent application that was mentioned above Ser. No. 12 964 050 entitled Magnetic Stimulation Devices and Methods of Therapy disclosed methods for using the device to treat such conditions as post operative ileus dysfunction associated with TNF alpha in Alzheimer s disease postoperative cognitive dysfunction rheumatoid arthritis bronchoconstriction urinary incontinence and or overactive bladder and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. The present application extends disclosure of the range of conditions that may be treated by magnetic stimulation or other non invasive techniques by disclosing methods and devices for treating neurodegenerative diseases more generally.

The present invention discloses methods for using vagal nerve stimulation to suppress neuroinflammation. In certain embodiments methods and devices of the present invention involve the inhibition of pro inflammatory cytokines or more specifically stimulation of the vagus nerve to inhibit and or block the release of such pro inflammatory cytokines. In other embodiments the present invention discloses use of vagal nerve stimulation to increase the concentration or effectiveness of anti inflammatory cytokines. TRACEY et al do not consider the modulation of anti inflammatory cytokines to be part of the cholinergic anti inflammatory pathway that their method of vagal nerve stimulation is intended to activate. Thus they explain that activation of vagus nerve cholinergic signaling inhibits TNF tumor necrosis factor and other proinflammatory cytokine overproduction through immune a7 nicotinic receptor mediated mechanisms V. A. PAVLOV and K. J. Tracey. Controlling inflammation the cholinergic anti inflammatory pathway. Biochemical Society Transactions 34 2006 6 1037 1040 . In contrast anti inflammatory cytokines are said to be part of a different diffusible anti inflammatory network which includes glucocorticoids anti inflammatory cytokines and other humoral mediators CZURA C J Tracey K J. Autonomic neural regulation of immunity. J Intern Med. 257 2005 2 156 66 . Others make a similar distinction between vagal and humoral mediation GUYON A Massa F Rov re C Nahon J L. How cytokines can influence the brain a role for chemokines J Neuroimmunol 2008 198 46 55 .

The disclaiming by TRACEY and colleagues of a role for anti inflammatory cytokines as mediators of inflammation following stimulation of the vagus nerve may be due to a recognition that anti inflammatory cytokines e.g. TGF are usually produced constitutively while pro inflammatory cytokines e.g. TNF alpha are not produced constitutively but are instead induced. However anti inflammatory cytokines are inducible as well as constitutive so that for example an increase in the concentrations of potentially anti inflammatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta TGF can in fact be accomplished through stimulation of the vagus nerve R A BAUMGARTNER V A Deramo and M A Beaven.

An example of a pro anti inflammatory mechanism that is particularly relevant to the treatment of multiple sclerosis is as follows. TGF converts undifferentiated T cells into regulatory T Treg cells that block the autoimmunity that causes demyelination in multiple sclerosis. However in the presence of interleukin 6 TGF also causes the differentiation of T lymphocytes into proinflammatory IL 17 cytokine producing T helper 17 TH17 cells which promote autoimmunity and inflammation. Thus it is conceivable that an increase of TGF levels might actually cause or exacerbate inflammation rather than suppress it. Accordingly a step in an embodiment of the methods that are disclosed herein is to deter TGF from realizing its pro inflammatory potential by selecting nerve stimulation parameters that bias the potential of TGF towards anti inflammation and or by treating the patient with an agent such as the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid that is known to promote such an anti inflammatory bias MUCIDA D Park Y Kim G Turovskaya O Scott I Kronenberg M Cheroutre H. Reciprocal TH17 and regulatory T cell differentiation mediated by retinoic acid. Science 317 2007 5835 256 60 Sheng XIAO Hulin Jin Thomas Korn Sue M. Liu Mohamed Oukka Bing Lim and Vijay K. Kuchroo. Retinoic acid increases Foxp3 regulatory T cells and inhibits development of Th17 cells by enhancing TGF driven Smad3 signaling and inhibiting IL 6 and IL 23 receptor expression. J. Immunol. 181 2008 4 2277 2284 . Retinoic acid is a member of a class of compounds known as retinoids comprising three generations 1 retinol retinal retinoic acid tretinoin Retin A isotretinoin and alitretinoin 2 etretinate and acitretin 3 tazarotene bexarotene and Adapalene.

In one embodiment of the invention endogenous retinoic acid that is released by neurons themselves is used to produce the anti inflammatory bias. Thus it is known that vagal nerve stimulation may induce differentiation through release of retinoic acid that is produced in neurons from retinaldehyde by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases and the disclosed invention promotes anti inflammatory regulatory T cell Treg differentiation by this type of mechanism van de PAVERT S A Olivier B J Goverse G Vondenhoff M F Greuter M Beke P Kusser K H pken U E Lipp M Niederreither K Blomhoff R Sitnik K Agace W W Randall T D de Jonge W J Mebius R E. Chemokine CXCL13 is essential for lymph node initiation and is induced by retinoic acid and neuronal stimulation. Nat Immunol. 10 11 2009 1193 1199 .

The retinoic acid so released might also directly inhibit the release or functioning of proinflammatory cytokines which would be an anti pro inflammatory mechanism that is distinct from the one proposed by TRACEY and colleagues Malcolm Maden. Retinoic acid in the development regeneration and maintenance of the nervous system. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 8 2007 755 765 . However if the proinflammatory cytokine that is blocked is TNF alpha its inhibition in multiple sclerosis patients might be counterproductive. This is because blocking TNF alpha with the drug lenercept promotes and exacerbates multiple sclerosis attacks rather than delaying them which might be attributable to the fact that TNF alpha promotes remyelination and the proliferation of oligodendrocytes that perform the myelination.

In this example the competence of anti inflammatory cytokines may be modulated by the retinoic acid RA signaling system of the nervous system. The most important mechanism of RA activity is the regulation of gene expression. This is accomplished by its binding to nuclear retinoid receptors that are ligand activated transcription factors. Thus RA acts as a transcriptional activator for a large number of other downstream regulatory molecules including enzymes transcription factors cytokines and cytokine receptors. Retinoic acid is an essential morphogen in vertebrate development and participates in tissue regeneration in the adult Jorg MEY and Peter MdCaffery. Retinoic Acid Signaling in the Nervous System of Adult Vertebrates. The Neuroscientist 10 5 2004 409 421 . RA also increases synaptic strength in a homeostatic response synaptic scaling to neuronal inactivity through a mechanism involving protein synthesis that requires the participation of TNF alpha. RA is also intimately involved in the control of the rhythmic electrical activity of the brain. More generally all trans retinoic acid 9 cis retinoic acid and 13 cis retinoic acid are some of a very small number of entrainment factors that regulate the natural rhythmicity of metabolic processes in many types of individual cells Mehdi Tafti Norbert B.

As examples involving other neurodegenerative diseases stimulation of nerves to enhance mechanisms involving retinoic acid or its receptors also promotes the rescue of dopamine producing cells in Parkinson s disease Stina Friling Maria Bergsland and Susanna Kjellander. Activation of Retinoid X Receptor increases dopamine cell survival in models for Parkinson s disease. BMC Neuroscience 2009 10 146 .

The potentially anti inflammatory cytokine TGF beta is a member of the TGF beta superfamily of neurotrophic factors. Neurotrophic factors serve as growth factors for the development maintenance repair and survival of specific neuronal populations acting via retrograde signaling from target neurons by paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. Other neurotrophic factors also promote the survival of neurons during neurodegeneration. These include members of the nerve growth factor NGF superfamily the glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor GDNF family the neurokine superfamily and non neuronal growth factors such as the insulin like growth factors IGF family. However major problems in using such neurotrophic factors for therapy are their inability to cross the blood brain barrier adverse effects resulting from binding to the receptor in other organs of the body and their low diffusion rate Yossef S. Levy Yossi Gilgun Sherki Eldad Melamed and Daniel Offen. Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors in Neurodegenerative Diseases. Biodrugs 2005 19 2 97 127 .

It is known that vagal nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation can increase the levels of at least one neurotrophic factor in the brain namely brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF in the NGF superfamily which has been studied extensively in connection with the treatment of depression. However vagal nerve stimulation to increase levels of neurotrophic factors has not been reported in connection with neurodegenerative diseases. Because BDNF may be modulated by stimulating the vagus nerve vagal nerve stimulation may likewise promote the expression of other neurotrophic factors in patients with neurodegenerative disease thereby circumventing the problem of blood brain barrier blockage Follesa P Biggio F Gorini G Caria S Talani G Dazzi L Puligheddu M Marrosu F Biggio G.

However that application is concerned with the search for biomarkers involving the levels of GDNF rather than a method for treating a neurodegenerative disease using vagal nerve stimulation.

Although the magnetic stimulator coil is shown in to be a single coil in practice the coil may also comprise two or more distinct coils each of which is connected in series or in parallel to the impulse generator . Thus the coil shown in represents all the magnetic stimulator coils of the device collectively. In the preferred embodiment that is disclosed below coil actually contains two coils that may be connected either in series or in parallel to the impulse generator .

The item labeled in as is a volume surrounding the coil that is filled with electrically conducting medium. As shown the medium not only encloses the magnetic stimulator coil but is also deformable such that it is form fitting when applied to the surface of the body. Thus the sinuousness or curvature shown at the outer surface of the electrically conducting medium correspond also to sinuousness or curvature on the surface of the body against which the conducting medium is applied so as to make the medium and body surface contiguous. As described below in connection with a preferred embodiment the volume is electrically connected to the patient at a target skin surface in order to significantly reduce the current passed through the coil that is needed to accomplish stimulation of the patient s nerve or tissue. As also described below in connection with a preferred embodiment conducting medium in which the coil is embedded need not completely surround the toroid.

The control unit controls the impulse generator to generate a signal for each of the device s magnetic stimulation coils. The signals are selected to be suitable for amelioration of a particular medical condition when the signals are applied non invasively to a target nerve or tissue via the magnetic stimulator coil . It is noted that nerve stimulating modulating device may be referred to by its function as a pulse generator. Patent application publications US2005 0075701 and US2005 0075702 both to SHAFER both of which are incorporated herein by reference relating to stimulation of neurons of the sympathetic nervous system to attenuate an immune response contain descriptions of pulse generators that may be applicable to the present invention when adapted for use with a magnetic stimulator coil. By way of example a pulse generator is also commercially available such as Agilent 33522A Function Arbitrary Waveform Generator Agilent Technologies Inc. 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd Santa Clara Calif. 95051.

The control unit may also comprise a general purpose computer comprising one or more CPU computer memories for the storage of executable computer programs including the system s operating system and the storage and retrieval of data disk storage devices communication devices such as serial and USB ports for accepting external signals from the system s keyboard and computer mouse as well as any externally supplied physiological signals analog to digital converters for digitizing externally supplied analog signals communication devices for the transmission and receipt of data to and from external devices such as printers and modems that comprise part of the system hardware for generating the display of information on monitors that comprise part of the system and busses to interconnect the above mentioned components. Thus the user may operate the system by typing instructions for the control unit at a device such as a keyboard and view the results on a device such as the system s computer monitor or direct the results to a printer modem and or storage disk. Control of the system may be based upon feedback measured from externally supplied physiological or environmental signals.

Parameters for the nerve or tissue stimulation include power level frequency and train duration or pulse number . The stimulation characteristics of each pulse such as depth of penetration strength and accuracy depend on the rise time peak electrical energy transferred to the coil and the spatial distribution of the electric field. The rise time and peak coil energy are governed by the electrical characteristics of the magnetic stimulator and stimulating coil whereas the spatial distribution of the induced electric field depends on the coil geometry and the anatomy of the region of induced current flow. In one embodiment of the invention pulse parameters are set in such as way as to account for the detailed anatomy surrounding the nerve that is being stimulated Bartosz SAWICKI Robert Szmurto Przemystaw Ptonecki Jacek Starzytiski Stanistaw Wincenciak Andrzej Rysz. Mathematical Modelling of Vagus Nerve Stimulation. pp. 92 97 in Krawczyk A. Electromagnetic Field Health and Environment Proceedings of EHE 07. Amsterdam IOS Press 2008 . A single pulse may be monophasic no current reversal within the coil biphasic or polyphasic. For rapid rate stimulators biphasic systems may be used wherein energy is recovered from each pulse in order to help energize the next. Embodiments of the invention include those that are fixed frequency where each pulse in a train has the same inter stimulus interval and those that have modulated frequency where the intervals between each pulse in a train can be varied.

The parameters of the modulation signal are preferably programmable such as the frequency amplitude duty cycle pulse width pulse shape etc. An external communication device may modify the pulse generator programming to improve treatment.

In addition or as an alternative to the devices to implement the modulation unit for producing the electrical voltage current profile of the stimulating blocking and or modulating impulse to the magnetic stimulator coil the device disclosed in patent publication No. US2005 0216062 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference may be employed. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005 0216062 discloses a multifunctional electrical stimulation ES system adapted to yield output signals for effecting electromagnetic or other forms of electrical stimulation for a broad spectrum of different biological and biomedical applications including magnetic stimulators which produce a high intensity magnetic field pulse in order to non invasively stimulate nerves. The system includes an ES signal stage having a selector coupled to a plurality of different signal generators each producing a signal having a distinct shape such as a sine wave a square or a saw tooth wave or simple or complex pulse the parameters of which are adjustable in regard to amplitude duration repetition rate and other variables. Examples of the signals that may be generated by such a system are described in a publication by LIBOFF A. R. LIBOFF. Signal shapes in electromagnetic therapies a primer. pp. 17 37 in Bioelectromagnetic Medicine Paul J. Rosch and Marko S. Markov eds. . New York Marcel Dekker 2004 . The signal from the selected generator in the ES stage is fed to at least one output stage where it is processed to produce a high or low voltage or current output of a desired polarity whereby the output stage is capable of yielding an electrical stimulation signal appropriate for its intended application. Also included in the system is a measuring stage which measures and displays the electrical stimulation signal operating on the substance being treated as well as the outputs of various sensors which sense conditions prevailing in this substance whereby the user of the system can manually adjust it or have it automatically adjusted by feedback to provide an electrical stimulation signal of whatever type he wishes and the user can then observe the effect of this signal on a substance being treated.

The stimulating blocking and or modulating impulse signal preferably has a frequency an amplitude a duty cycle a pulse width a pulse shape etc. selected to influence the therapeutic result namely stimulating blocking and or modulating some or all of the transmission of the selected nerve. For example the frequency may be about 1 Hz or greater such as between about 15 Hz to 50 Hz more preferably around 25 Hz. The modulation signal may have a pulse width selected to influence the therapeutic result such as about 20 microseconds or greater such as about 20 microseconds to about 1000 microseconds. For example the electric field induced by the device within tissue in the vicinity of a nerve is 10 to 600 V m preferably around 300 V m. The gradient of the electric field may be greater than 2 V m mm. More generally the stimulation device produces an electric field in the vicinity of the nerve that is sufficient to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation which is approximately 8 V m at 1000 Hz.

The preferred embodiment of magnetic stimulator coil comprises a toroidal winding around a core consisting of high permeability material e.g. Supermendur embedded in an electrically conducting medium. Toroidal coils with high permeability cores have been theoretically shown to greatly reduce the currents required for transcranial TMS and other forms of magnetic stimulation but only if the toroids are embedded in a conducting medium and placed against tissue with no air interface.

In order to explain some of the novelty of the presently disclosed invention as compared with the device described in the above mentioned Carbunaru and Durand publication as well as in the FAIERSTEIN dissertation upon which the publication was based it is useful to first summarize the relevant physics of electric fields and currents that are induced by time varying magnetic fields as produced by current carrying coils Richard P. FEYNMAN Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands. The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Volume II. Addison Wesley Publ. Co. Reading Mass. 1964 page 15 15 K. P. ESSELLE and M. A.

The magnetic field B may be represented as the curl of a vector potential A where B and A are functions of position and time B A.

The electric field E which is also a function of position and time consists of two parts Eand E E E E. For a current carrying coil Eis obtained from the vector potential A by 

Eis obtained from the gradient of a scalar potential E . The scalar potential arises because conductivity changes along the path of a current particularly the abrupt change of conductivity at an air conductor interface causes electric charges to separate and accumulate on the surface of the interface with the amplitude and sign of the charges changing as a function of surface position. Thus no conduction current can flow across an air conductor interface so according to the interfacial boundary conditions the component of any induced current normal to the interface must be zero. The existence of a scalar potential accounts for these effects.

The electrical current density J which is also a function of position and time consists of two parts J J J corresponding to the two parts of E J Eand J E where the conductivity is generally a tensor and a function of position. If the current flows in material that is essentially unpolarizable i.e. is presumed not to be a dielectric any displacement current may be ignored so the current would satisfy Ampere s law 

If the displacement current cannot be ignored the displacement appears as a term involving the time derivative of the electric field in the more general expression E t E1 0 where is the permittivity which is a function of position and is generally a tensor. As a consequence of such a term the waveform of the electric field at any point will generally be altered relative to the waveform of the current I t that is passed through the coils. Furthermore if the permittivity of a material in the device is itself selected to be a function of the electric field then the equation becomes non linear which could exhibit multiple solutions frequency multiplication and other such non linear behavior.

The above mentioned publication by CARBUNARU and Durand as well as the FAIERSTEIN dissertation upon which the publication was based are heretofore unique in that they describe a magnetic stimulation device that does not create a magnetic field within the tissues that the device is intended to stimulate. Their device instead confines the magnetic field to a toroid which is the only coil geometry known to create a magnetic field that is completely limited to part of space. With such a device the electric field alone penetrates the patient to stimulate nerves or tissue which they calculate using device specific equations for the fields Eand Ethat were defined above. Unlike conventional magnetic stimulation devices their device s electric field orientation is not limited to fields at the skin that are parallel to the skin surface due to the presence of conducting material that extends from the skin to and beyond the stimulator s coil. The boundary conditions giving rise to Ewere those of an infinite half space. Thus their toroidal coil was immersed in a homogeneous continuous conducting material that had an air conductor interface along an infinite plane parallel to the toroid located at a variable distance from the toroid and the toroid and conducting material were in contact with a patient s skin.

In their investigations Carbunaru and Durand varied Eby only changing the coil geometry integral over dl as follows. They investigated winding the coil around different core geometries round quarter circle square and changed the radius and thickness of the core. They also varied Eby varying the thickness of the conducting layer in which the toroid was immersed thereby changing boundary conditions only in that manner. Although Carbunaru and Durand demonstrated that it is possible to electrically stimulate a patient transcutaneously with such a device they made no attempt to develop the device in such a way as to generally shape the electric field that is to stimulate the nerve. In particular the electric fields that may be produced by their device are limited to those that are radially symmetric at any given depth of stimulation into the patient i.e. z and are used to specify location of the field not x y and z . This is a significant limitation and it results in a deficiency that was noted in of their publication at large depths of stimulation the threshold current in the device s coil for long axons is larger than the saturation current of the coil. Stimulation of those axons is only possible at low threshold points such as bending sites or tissue conductivity inhomogeneities . Thus for their device varying the parameters that they considered in order to increase the electric field or its gradient in the vicinity of a nerve may come at the expense of limiting the field s physiological effectiveness such that the spatial extent of the field of stimulation may be insufficient to modulate the target nerve s function. Yet such long axons are precisely what we may wish to stimulate in therapeutic interventions such as the ones disclosed herein. Accordingly it is an objective of the present invention to shape an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to such a long nerve. The term shape an electric field as used herein means to create an electric field or its gradient that is generally not radially symmetric at a given depth of stimulation in the patient especially a field that is characterized as being elongated or finger like and especially also a field in which the magnitude of the field in some direction may exhibit more than one spatial maximum i.e. may be bimodal or multimodal such that the tissue between the maxima may contain an area across which induced current flow is restricted. Shaping of the electric field refers both to the circumscribing of regions within which there is a significant electric field and to configuring the directions of the electric field within those regions.

Thus the present invention differs from the device disclosed by CARBUNARU and Durand by deliberately shaping an electric field that is used to transcutaneously stimulate the patient. Our invention does so by configuring elements that are present within the equations that were summarized above comprising but not limited to the following exemplary configurations that may be used alone or in combination.

First the contours of the coil differential elements dl that are integrated in the above equation for Eare shaped into a geometry other than a single planar toroid. For example two separate toroidal coils are used so that Ebecomes the sum of two integrals or the shape of a single toroid is twisted to resemble a figure of 8 rather than a planar toroid.

Second the value of the current I in the above equation for Eis manipulated to shape the electric field. For example if the device contains two toroidal coils the current in one toroid may be the negative of the current in the other toroid. As another example the magnitude of the current in a left toroidal coil may be varied relative to the magnitude of the current in a right toroidal coil so that the location of their superimposed induced electric fields may be correspondingly moved focused in the left or right directions. As another example the waveform of the current in a left toroidal coil may be different than the waveform of the current in a right toroidal coil so that their superimposed induced electric fields may exhibit beat frequencies as has been attempted with electrode based stimulators U.S. Pat. No. 5 512 057 entitled Interferential stimulator for applying localized stimulation to REISS et al. and acoustic stimulators U.S. Pat. No. 5 903 516 entitled Acoustic force generator for detection imaging and information transmission using the beat signal of multiple intersecting sonic beams to GREENLEAF et al .

Third the scalar potential in the above equation for Eis manipulated to shape the electric field. For example this is accomplished by changing the boundaries of conductor air or non conductor interfaces thereby creating different boundary conditions. Whereas the toroid in the CARBUNARU and Durand publication was immersed in a homogeneous conducting half space this is not necessarily the case for our invention. Although our invention will generally have some continuously conducting path between the device s coil and the patient s skin the conducting medium need not totally immerse the coil and there may be insulating voids within the conducting medium. For example if the device contains two toroids conducting material may connect each of the toroids individually to the patient s skin but there may be an insulating gap from air or some other insulator between the surfaces at which conducting material connected to the individual toroids contact the patient. Furthermore the area of the conducting material that contacts the skin may be made variable by using an aperture adjusting mechanism such as an iris diaphragm. As another example if the coil is wound around core material that is laminated with the core in contact with the device s electrically conducting material then the lamination may be extended into the conducting material in such a way as to direct the induced electrical current between the laminations and towards the surface of the patient s skin. As another example the conducting material may pass through apertures in an insulated mesh before contacting the patient s skin creating thereby an array of electric field maxima.

Fourth the conductivity a in the equations J Eand J E may be varied spatially within the device by using two or more different conducting materials that are in contact with one another for given boundary conditions. The conductivity may also be varied by constructing some conducting material from a semiconductor which allows for adjustment of the conductivity in space and in time by exposure of the semiconductor to agents to which they are sensitive such as electric fields light at particular wavelengths temperature or some other environmental variable over which the user of the device has control. For the special case in which the semiconductor s conductivity may be made to approach zero that would approximate the imposition of an interfacial boundary condition as described in the previous paragraph. As another example the conducting material of the device may be selected to have a three dimensional conductivity structure that approximates that of the conducting tissue under the patient s skin but oriented in the opposite and or mirror image directions in such a way that the conductivity is symmetrical on either side of the patient s skin. Such an arrangement will allow for essentially symmetrical electrical stimulation of the patient s tissue and the conducting material within the device.

Fifth a dialectric material having a high permittivity such as Mylar neoprene titanium dioxide or strontium titanate may be used in the device for example in order to permit capacitative electrical coupling to the patient s skin.

Sixth the present invention is more general than the device described in the above mentioned publication of CARBUNARU and Durand in that although the magnetic field produced by the present invention does not effectively penetrate the patient s tissue that feature need not be due to the use of a toroidal coil. The magnetic field will not effectively penetrate the patient s tissue if the field s de minimis existence within the patient would produce no significant physiological effect. For example it would not produce a significant physiological effect if the magnitude of the magnetic field were of the same order of magnitude as the earth s magnetic field. The magnetic field of our disclosed device may be produced by a coil other than a toroid wherein the magnetic field outside the coil falls rapidly as a function of distance from the coil. For example the coil may be a solenoid that has an approximately centrally confined magnetic field as the density of coil turns and the length of the solenoid increase. As another example the coil may be a partial toroid which would also have a magnetic field that approximates that of a complete toroid as the gap within the partial toroid decreases to zero. As another example even if one is attempting to construct a complete toroidal winding the presence of lead wires and imperfections of the winding may cause the device in practice to deviate from the ideal toroid. Such non toroidal windings may be used in the present invention if they are backed away and or oriented relative to the patient s skin in such a way that the magnetic field that is produced by the device does not effectively penetrate the patient s tissue. Alternatively magnetic shielding such as niumetal supermalloy supermumetal nilomag sanbold molybdenum permalloy Sendust M 1040 Hipernom and HyMu 80 may be interposed between the patient and coil of the device in such a way that the magnetic field that is produced by the device does not effectively penetrate the patient s tissue.

In the dissertation cited above Carbunaru FAIERSTEIN made no attempt to use conducting material other than agar in a KCl solution and he made no attempt to devise a device that could be conveniently and safely applied to a patient s skin at an arbitrary angle without the conducting material spilling out of its container. It is therefore an objective of the present invention to disclose conducting material that can be used not only to adapt the conductivity and select boundary conditions thereby shaping the electric fields and currents as described above but also to create devices that can be applied practically to any surface of the body. The volume of the container containing electrically conducting medium is labeled in as . Use of the container of conducting medium allows one to generate induce electric fields in tissue and electric field gradients and electric currents that are equivalent to those generated using current magnetic stimulation devices but with about 0.001 to 0.1 of the current conventionally applied to a magnetic stimulation coil. This allows for minimal heating and deeper tissue stimulation. However application of the conducting medium to the surface of the patient is difficult to perform in practice because the tissue contours head for TMS arms legs neck etc. for peripheral nerve stimulation are not planar. To solve this problem in the preferred embodiment of the present invention the toroidal coil is embedded in a structure which is filled with a conducting medium having approximately the same conductivity as muscle tissue as now described.

In one embodiment of the invention the container contains holes so that the conducting material e.g. a conducting gel can make physical contact with the patient s skin through the holes. For example the conducting medium may comprise a chamber surrounding the coil filled with a conductive gel that has the approximate viscosity and mechanical consistency of gel deodorant e.g. Right Guard Clear Gel from Dial Corporation 15501 N. Dial Boulevard Scottsdale Ariz. 85260 one composition of which comprises aluminum chlorohydrate sorbitol propylene glycol polydimethylsiloxanes Silicon oil cyclomethicone ethanol SD Alcohol 40 dimethicone copolyol aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly and water . The gel which is less viscous than conventional electrode gel is maintained in the chamber with a mesh of openings at the end where the device is to contact the patient s skin. The gel does not leak out and it can be dispensed with a simple screw driven piston.

In another embodiment the container itself is made of a conducting elastomer e.g. dry carbon filled silicone elastomer and electrical contact with the patient is through the elastomer itself possibly through an additional outside coating of conducting material. In some embodiments of the invention the conducting medium may be a balloon filled with a conducting gel or conducting powders or the balloon may be constructed extensively from deformable conducting elastomers. The balloon conforms to the skin surface removing any air thus allowing for high impedance matching and conduction of large electric fields in to the tissue. A device such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 591 776 entitled Magnetic stimulators and stimulating coils to PHILLIPS et al. may conform the coil itself to the contours of the body but in the preferred embodiment such a curved coil is also enclosed by a container that is filled with a conducting medium that deforms to be contiguous with the skin.

Agar can also be used as part of the conducting medium but it is not preferred because agar degrades in time is not ideal to use against skin and presents difficulties with cleaning the patient and stimulator coil. Use of agar in a 4M KCl solution as a conducting medium was mentioned in the above cited dissertation Rafael Carbunaru FAIERSTEIN Coil Designs for Localized and Efficient Magnetic Stimulation of the Nervous System. Ph.D. Dissertation Department of Biomedical Engineering Case Western Reserve May 1999 page 117 UMI Microform Number 9940153 UMI Company Ann Arbor Mich. . However that publication makes no mention or suggestion of placing the agar in a conducting elastomeric balloon or other deformable container so as to allow the conducting medium to conform to the generally non planar contours of a patient s skin having an arbitrary orientation. In fact that publication describes the coil as being submerged in a container filled with an electrically conducting solution. If the coil and container were placed on a body surface that was oriented in the vertical direction then the conducting solution would spill out making it impossible to stimulate the body surface in that orientation. In contrast the present invention is able to stimulate body surfaces having arbitrary orientation. Examples making use of the present device show the body surface as having many different orientations that are incompatible with the disclosure in the above cited dissertation.

That dissertation also makes no mention of a dispensing method whereby the agar would be made contiguous with the patient s skin. A layer of electrolytic gel is said to have been applied between the skin and coil but the configuration was not described clearly in the publication. In particular no mention is made of the electrolytic gel being in contact with the agar.

Rather than using agar as the conducting medium the coil can instead be embedded in a conducting solution such as 1 10 NaCl contacting an electrically conducting interface to the human tissue. Such an interface is used as it allows current to flow from the coil into the tissue and supports the medium surrounded toroid so that it can be completely sealed. Thus the interface is material interposed between the conducting medium and patient s skin that allows the conducting medium e.g. saline solution to slowly leak through it allowing current to flow to the skin. Several interfaces are disclosed as follows.

One interface comprises conducting material that is hydrophilic such as Tecophlic from The Lubrizol Corporation 29400 Lakeland Boulevard Wickliffe Ohio 44092. It absorbs from 10 100 of its weight in water making it highly electrically conductive while allowing only minimal bulk fluid flow.

Another material that may be used as an interface is a hydrogel such as that used on standard EEG EKG and TENS electrodes Rylie A GREEN Sungchul Baek Laura A Poole Warren and Penny J Martens. Conducting polymer hydrogels for medical electrode applications. Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 11 2010 014107 13 pp . For example it may be the following hypoallergenic bacteriostatic electrode gel SIGNAGEL Electrode Gel from Parker Laboratories Inc. 286 Eldridge Rd. Fairfield N.J. 07004.

A third type of interface may be made from a very thin material with a high dielectric constant such as those used to make capacitors. For example Mylar can be made in submicron thicknesses and has a dielectric constant of about 3. Thus at stimulation frequencies of several kilohertz or greater the Mylar will capacitively couple the signal through it because it will have an impedance comparable to that of the skin itself. Thus it will isolate the toroid and the solution it is embedded in from the tissue yet allow current to pass.

The preferred embodiment of the magnetic stimulator coil in reduces the volume of conducting material that must surround a toroidal coil by using two toroids side by side and passing electrical current through the two toroidal coils in opposite directions. In this configuration the induced current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium. Thus minimal space for the conducting medium is required around the outside of the toroids at positions near from the gap between the pair of coils. An additional advantage of using two toroids in this configuration is that this design will greatly increase the magnitude of the electric field gradient between them which is crucial for exciting long straight axons such as the vagus nerve and certain peripheral nerves.

This preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in respectively provide top and bottom views of the outer surface of the toroidal magnetic stimulator . respectively provide top and bottom views of the toroidal magnetic stimulator after sectioning along its long axis to reveal the inside of the stimulator.

As seen in the coils and cores around which they are wound are mounted as close as practical to the corresponding mesh with openings through which conducting gel passes to the surface of the patient s skin. As seen in each coil and the core around which it is wound is mounted in its own housing the function of which is to provide mechanical support to the coil and core as well as to electrically insulate a coil from its neighboring coil. With this design induced current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium.

Different diameter toroidal coils and windings may be preferred for different applications. For a generic application the outer diameter of the core may be typically 1 to 5 cm with an inner diameter typically 0.5 to 0.75 of the outer diameter. The coil s winding around the core may be typically 3 to 250 in number depending on the core diameter and depending on the desired coil inductance.

The embodiment shown in contains two toroids in which the outer surface of the toroids are planar the toroids lie side by side and the corresponding outer surfaces for both toroids lie essentially in the same plane. Many different embodiments are also contemplated each of which may be better suited to the stimulation of particular nerves or tissues. Examples of such alternate embodiments are illustrated in showing the geometry of the toroidal core material around which coils of wire not shown would be wound. The darkened faces of the figures shown there indicate the faces that would be oriented towards the patient s skin. Instead of placing the toroids side by side as in a pair of toroids may be placed concentrically as shown in . Instead of using two toroids any number could be used as illustrated by that shows four concentrically positioned toroids. Individual planar toroids need not all lie in the same plane as shown in . In fact the toroids themselves need not have a planar structure as illustrated in . Furthermore the toroids need not have a round structure or a structure comprising arcs as illustrated in which shows a pair of concentrically positioned square toroids. The examples shown here have toroids that are rectangular or square when sectioned perpendicular to their perimeters. In other embodiments the sectioned toroid could have any other closed geometry such as a circle or an ellipse or a geometry that changes from one part of the toroid to another.

Thus the geometrical configuration of the disclosed device is general. For example it may comprise a plurality of toroids. It may comprise two toroids wherein one toroid lies within the aperture of the second toroid. A surface having a minimum area that fills an aperture of a toroid need not lie within a plane. The projection of the volume of a toroidal core onto a plane need not produce a circular shape around any perimeter of any such projection. For a plurality of toroids a plane having a greatest area of intersection through one toroid among the plurality may but need not be parallel to a plane having a greatest area of intersection through some second toroid among the plurality.

The design and methods of use of impulse generators control units and stimulator coils for magnetic stimulators are informed by the designs and methods of use of impulse generators control units and electrodes with leads for comparable completely electrical nerve stimulators but design and methods of use of the magnetic stimulators must take into account many special considerations making it generally not straightforward to transfer knowledge of completely electrical stimulation methods to magnetic stimulation methods. Such considerations include determining the anatomical location of the stimulation and determining the appropriate pulse configuration OLNEY R K So Y T Goodin D S Aminoff M J.

In the preferred embodiment of the invention electronic components of the stimulator impulse generator control unit and power source are compact portable and simple to operate. The preferred simplicity is illustrated in which shows the stimulator coil housing illustrated in more detail as in which is connected by electrical cable to a circuit control box . As shown in the circuit control box will generally require only an on off switch and a power controller provided that the parameters of stimulation described in connection with have already been programmed for the particular application of the device. For such a portable device power is provided by batteries e.g. a 9 volt battery or two to six 1.5V AA batteries. A covering cap is also provided to fit snugly over the mesh in of the stimulator coil housing in order to keep the housing s conducting medium from leaking or drying when the device is not in use.

In the preferred embodiment for a generic therapeutic application the currents passing through the coils of the magnetic stimulator will saturate the core e.g. 0.1 to 2 Tesla magnetic field strength for Supermendur core material . This will require approximately 0.5 to 20 amperes of current being passed through each coil typically 2 amperes with voltages across each coil of 10 to 100 volts. The current is passed through the coils in bursts of pulses. The burst repeats at 1 Hz to 5000 Hz preferably at 15 50 Hz. The pulses have duration of 20 to 1000 microseconds preferably 200 microseconds and there may be 1 to 20 pulses per burst. Other waveforms described above in connection with are also generated depending on the nerve or tissue stimulation application.

Examples in the remaining disclosure will be directed to use of the disclosed toroidal magnetic stimulation device for treatment of specific medical conditions. These applications involve stimulating a patient in and around the patient s neck. However it will be appreciated that the systems and methods of the present invention can be applied equally well to other tissues and nerves of the body including but not limited to parasympathetic nerves sympathetic nerves spinal or cranial nerves and brain tissue. In addition the present invention can be used to directly or indirectly stimulate or otherwise modulate nerves that innervate smooth or skeletal muscle endocrine glands and organs of the digestive system.

In some preferred embodiments of methods that make use of the disclosed toroidal coil magnetic stimulation device selected nerve fibers are stimulated. These include stimulation of the vagus nerve at a location in the patient s neck. At that location the vagus nerve is situated within the carotid sheath near the carotid artery and the interior jugular vein. The carotid sheath is located at the lateral boundary of the retopharyngeal space on each side of the neck and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The left vagus nerve is ordinarily selected for stimulation because stimulation of the right vagus nerve may produce undesired effects on the heart.

The three major structures within the carotid sheath are the common carotid artery the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve. The carotid artery lies medial to the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve is situated posteriorly between the two vessels. Typically the location of the carotid sheath or interior jugular vein in a patient and therefore the location of the vagus nerve will be ascertained in any manner known in the art e.g. by feel or ultrasound imaging. Proceeding from the skin of the neck above the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the vagus nerve a line may pass successively through the sternocleidomastoid muscle the carotid sheath and the internal jugular vein unless the position on the skin is immediately to either side of the external jugular vein. In the latter case the line may pass successively through only the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath before encountering the vagus nerve missing the interior jugular vein. Accordingly a point on the neck adjacent to the external jugular vein might be preferred for non invasive stimulation of the vagus nerve. The magnetic stimulator coil may be centered on such a point at the level of about the fifth to sixth cervical vertebra.

Magnetic stimulation has been used by several investigators to non invasively stimulate the vagus nerve in the neck and at other locations. In a series of articles beginning in 1992 Aziz and colleagues describe using non invasive magnetic stimulation to electrically stimulate the vagus nerve in the neck. Q. AZIZ et al.

He stimulated at 175 joules per pulse 40 Hz frequency 10 seconds on 10 seconds off for 20 minutes duration and followed by 60 minutes of rest and this sequence was performed for 5 cycles in each subject.

The vagus is not the only nerve that may be stimulated non invasively in the neck using magnetic stimulation. For example the phrenic nerve has also been magnetically stimulated. SIMILOWSKI T. B.

If one intends to stimulate only the vagus nerve careful positioning of the stimulator coil should be undertaken in order to avoid co stimulation of the phrenic nerve or the magnetic stimulation waveform may be designed to minimize the effect of any co stimulation of the vagus and phrenic nerves patent application JP2008 081479A entitled Vagus nerve stimulation system to YOSHIHOTO .

If it is desired to maintain a constant intensity of stimulation in the vicinity of the vagus nerve or any other nerve or tissue that is being stimulated methods may also be employed to modulate the power of the stimulator in order to compensate for patient motion or other mechanisms that would otherwise give rise to variability in the intensity of stimulation. In the case of stimulation of the vagus nerve such variability may be attributable to the patient s breathing which may involve contraction and associated change in geometry of the sternocleidomastoid muscle that is situated close to the vagus nerve identified as in . Methods for compensating for motion and other confounding factors were disclosed by the present applicant in co pending application Ser. No. 12 859 568 entitled Non Invasive Treatment of Bronchial Constriction to SIMON which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Several examples follow exemplifying therapies for neurodegenerative disorders that involve stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck using magnetic stimulation devices. However it is understood that stimulation of the vagus nerve could also be performed at locations other than the neck Polak T Markulin F Ehlis A C Langer J B Ringel T M Fallgatter A J. Far field potentials from brain stem after transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation optimization of stimulation and recording parameters. J Neural Transm. 2009 October 116 10 1237 42 . It is also understood that non invasive methods other than magnetic stimulation may also be used to stimulate the vagus nerve in order to achieve the intended therapeutic effects. In particular the non invasive methods and devices that Applicant disclosed in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 859 568 entitled Non invasive Treatment of Bronchial Constriction to SIMON may also be used. It is also understood that stimulation of nerves other than the vagus nerve may also achieve the intended therapeutic results including those in the sympathetic nervous system particularly the splenic nerve.

Two types of pathways are shown in . The pathways that stimulate or upregulate are indicated with an arrow . The pathways that inhibit or downregulate are indicated with a blockage bar . Pathways resulting from stimulation of the vagus nerve are shown to stimulate retinoic acid anti inflammatory cytokines such as TGF beta and neurotrophic factors such as BDNF. The patient may also be treated with retinoic acid or some other retinoid by administering it as a drug . For cytokines that may have both anti inflammatory and pro inflammatory capabilities the retinoic acid biases such cytokines to exhibit their anti inflammatory potential as shown in the pathway labeled as . Pro inflammatory cytokines on the other hand promote inflammation by pathways labeled as . Stimulation of the vagus nerve inhibits the release of pro inflammatory cytokines directly through pathways that have been described by TRACEY and colleagues. The other pathways shown in to inhibit inflammation following stimulation of the vagus nerve are novel to this disclosure and include inhibition of inflammation via anti inflammatory cytokine pathways including those that inhibit the release of pro inflammatory cytokines inhibition via neurotrophic factors including those that inhibit the release of pro inflammatory cytokines and inhibition via retinoic acid pathways including those that inhibit the release of pro inflammatory cytokines .

It is understood that the labels in that are used for simplicity to describe the pathways actually refer to a large set of related pathways. For example the box labeled as retinoic acid actually refers to not only retinoic acid but also to a larger class of retinoids as well as to retinaldehyde dehydrogenases retinoic acid receptors RAR retinoid X receptors RXR retinoic acid response elements RAREs and more generally to the retinoic acid signaling system of the nervous system and related pathways.

Furthermore it is understood that the box labeled Anti Inflammatory Cytokine e.g. TGF beta can actually be placed within the box entitled Neurotrophic Factor because TFG beta is a member of the superfamily of TGF beta neurotrophic factors Yossef S. Levy Yossi Gilgun Sherki Eldad Melamed and Daniel Offen. Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors in Neurodegenerative Diseases. Biodrugs 2005 19 2 97 127 . However because TGF beta is ordinarily referred to simply as a cytokine and because its anti inflammatory competence is known to be influenced by retinoic acid it was placed in a separate box to avoid undue confusion.

Alzheimer or Alzheimer s disease AD is the most common cause of dementia affecting more than 5 million individuals in the United States. AD clinical decline and pathological processes occur gradually. Dementia is the end stage of many years of accumulation of pathological changes which begin to develop decades before the earliest clinical symptoms occur. A pre symptomatic phase occurs first in which individuals are cognitively normal but some have AD pathological changes. This is followed by a second prodromal phase of AD commonly referred to as mild cognitive impairment MCI . The final phase in the evolution of AD is dementia defined as impairments that are severe enough to produce loss of function.

Until recently a definitive diagnosis of AD could only be made at the autopsy or by brain biopsy of an individual by identifying amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles NFTs in the association regions of the individual s brain particularly in the medial aspect of the temporal lobe. Additional evidence of AD from an individual s autopsy or biopsy would include the presence of the following the granulovacuolar degeneration of Shimkowicz the neuropil threads of Braak and neuronal loss with synaptic degeneration.

Amyloid precursor protein APP is a membrane protein that is concentrated in the synapses of neurons. APP is the precursor molecule whose proteolysis generates amyloid AR a peptide whose amyloid fibrillar form is the primary component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of AD patients.

Tau proteins which are abundant in the central nervous system stabilize microtubules. When tau proteins are defective and no longer stabilize microtubules properly they can produce dementias including AD. Defective tau protein will aggregate and twist into neurofibrillary tangles NFTs so that the protein is no longer available the stabilization of microtubules. As a result the neuronal cytoskeleton falls apart contributing to neuronal malfunction and cell death.

AD begins when cells abnormally process the amyloid precursor protein APP which then leads to excess production or reduced clearance of amyloid A in the cortex. Excess of one or more forms of A leads to a cascade characterized by abnormal tau protein aggregation synaptic dysfunction cell death and brain shrinkage. The detailed molecular mechanism of tau protein aggregation is unknown but it is thought that extracellular deposits of A in the brains of AD patients promote tau polymerization.

Inflammation and the immune system play a significant role in AD pathogenesis. The inflammatory components in AD include microglia and astrocytes the complement system and various inflammatory mediators including cytokines and chemokines . Microglia are the resident immune cell types of the central nervous system and in AD microglia may cause damage by secretion of neurotoxins. When microglia become activated during inflammation they also secrete a variety of inflammatory mediators including cytokines TNF and interleukins IL 1 and IL 6 and chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein MIP 1a monocyte chemoattractant protein MCP 1 and interferon inducible protein IP 10 that promote the inflammatory state.

Microglia accumulate in locations that contain AI and are associated with the local toxicity of A plaques. Whether the accumulated microglia contribute to the removal or deposition of plaque is now thought to depend on the detailed microenvironment of the accumulated microglia. Microglial cell activation and migration toward amyloid plaques precede the appearance of abnormally shaped neurites and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. It has been shown that following microglial migration to the plaques microglial derived proinflammatory cytokine TNF alpha is induced which in turn induces accumulation of the aggregation prone tau molecules in neurites via reactive oxygen species. GORLOVY P. Larionov S. Pham T. T. H. Neumann H. Accumulation of tau induced in neurites by microglial proinflammatory mediators. FASEB J. 23 2502 2513 2009 . Elevated levels of TNF alpha also induce an increased expression of interleukin 1 which in turn increases production of the precursors that may be necessary for formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Thus the secretion of TNF alpha by microglia contributes to a cycle wherein tau aggregates to form tangles amyloid plaques are formed microglia aggregate to those plaques and more TNF alpha is secreted by microglia cells.

In addition to its proinflammatory functions TNF alpha is a gliotransmitter that regulates synaptic function in neural networks. In particular TNF alpha has been shown to mediate the disruption in synaptic memory mechanisms. Etanercept a biologic antagonist of TNF alpha when delivered by perispinal administration has been shown to improve the cognitive abilities of AD patients even within minutes of its administration Edward L TOBINICK and Hyman Gross. Rapid cognitive improvement in Alzheimer disease following perispinal etanercept administration. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2008 5 2 W Sue T GRIFFIN. Perispinal etanercept Potential as an Alzheimer therapeutic. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2008 5 3 Edward TOBINICK. Tumour Necrosis Factor Modulation for Treatment of Alzheimer s Disease Rationale and Current Evidence. CNS Drugs 2009 23 9 713 725 . Furthermore in a population of adults with rheumatoid arthritis CHOU et al. observed that the risk of AD was significantly reduced by TNF inhibitor therapy for the rheumatoid arthritis but not by other disease modifying agents used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It may therefore be concluded that TNF may be an important component in the pathogenesis of AD Richard C. CHOU Michael A. Kane Shiva Gautam and Sanjay Ghirmire. Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibition Reduces the Incidence of Alzheimer s Disease in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients. Program abstracts of the American College of Rheumatology Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals Scientific Meeting Nov. 8 2010 Atlanta Ga. Presentation No. 640 .

With the ability to better stage the progression of AD through use of biomarkers treatment of AD may be justified at stages prior to actual dementia. With a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AD those treatments might be directed to slowing stopping or reversing the pathophysiological processes underlying AD.

Biomarkers are cognitive physiological biochemical and anatomical variables that can be measured in a patient that indicate the progression of AD. The most commonly measured biomarkers are decreased A 42 in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF increased CSF tau decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET FOG PET PET amyloid imaging and structural MRI measures of cerebral atrophy. Biomarkers of A deposition become abnormal early before neurodegeneration and clinical symptoms occur. Biomarkers of neuronal injury dysfunction and neurodegeneration become abnormal later in the disease. Cognitive symptoms are directly related to biomarkers of neurodegeneration rather than to biomarkers of A deposition.

At the present time other than physical and mental exercise only symptomatic therapies for AD are available. All approved drugs for the symptomatic treatment of AD modulate neurotransmitters either acetylcholine or glutamate cholinesterase inhibitors and partial N methyl D aspartate antagonists. Psychotropic medications are also used to treat secondary symptoms of AD such as depression agitation and sleep disorders.

Therapies directed to modifying AD progression itself are considered investigational. These include treatment of the intense inflammation that occurs in the brains of patients with AD estrogen therapy use of free radical scavengers therapies designed to decrease toxic amyloid fragments in the brain vaccination anti amyloid antibodies selective amyloid lowering agents chelating agents to prevent amyloid polymerization brain shunting to improve removal of amyloid and beta secretase inhibitors to prevent generation of the A beta amyloid fragment and agents that may prevent or reverse excess tau phosphorylation and thereby diminish formation of neurofibrillary tangles.

However it is increasingly recognized that a single target or pathogenic pathway for the treatment of AD is unlikely to be identified. The best strategy is a multi target therapy that includes multiple types of treatments Mangialasche F Solomon A Winblad B Mecocci P Kivipelto M. Alzheimer disease clinical trials and drug development. Lancet Neurol. 2010 July 9 7 702 16 . Targets in that multi target approach will include inflammatory pathways and several therapeutic agents have been proposed to target them nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs statins RAGE antagonists and antioxidants Stuchbury G M nch G. Alzheimer associated inflammation potential drug targets and future therapies. J Neural Transm. 2005 March 112 3 429 53 . Another such agent Etanercept was mentioned above as targeting TNF alpha but its use has the disadvantage that because it does not pass the blood brain barrier BBB its administration is via a painful spinal route or via an experimental method to get through the BBB U.S. Pat. No. 7 640 062 entitled Methods and systems for management of alzheimer s disease to SHALEV . One TNF inhibitor that does not have this disadvantage is thalidomide Tweedie D Sambamurti K Greig N H TNF alpha Inhibition as a Treatment Strategy for Neurodegenerative Disorders New Drug Candidates and Targets. Curr Alzheimer Res 2007 4 4 375 8 . However thalidomide is well known by the public to cause birth defects and in a small trial its use did not appear to improve cognition in AD patients Peggy PECK. IADRD Pilot Study of Thalidomide for Alzheimer s Disease Fails to Detect Cognitive Benefit but Finds Effect on TNF alpha. Doctor s Guide Global Edition Jul. 26 2002 . There is therefore a need in the art for new therapies that target TNF alpha including its physiological activity for a given amount as a component of a multi target approach to treating AD

In 2002 it was reported that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve has a beneficial effect on cognition in patients with AD Sj gren M J Hellstr m P T Jonsson M A Runnerstam M Silander H C Ben Menachem E. Cognition enhancing effect of vagus nerve stimulation in patients with Alzheimer s disease a pilot study. J Clin Psychiatry. 2002 November 63 11 972 80 . The rationale for the trial was that vagus nerve stimulation had previously been found to enhance the cognitive abilities of patients that were undergoing vagus nerve stimulation for other conditions such as epilepsy and depression as well cognitive abilities observed in animal studies. Results concerning the AD patients improved cognitive abilities over a longer period of time along with improvement in tau protein of cerebrospinal fluid were subsequently reported Merrill C A Jonsson M A Minthon L Ejnell H C son Silander H Blennow K Karlsson M Nordlund A Rolstad S Warkentin S Ben Menachem E Sj gren M J. Vagus nerve stimulation in patients with Alzheimer s disease Additional follow up results of a pilot study through 1 year. J Clin Psychiatry. 2006 August 67 8 1171 8 . Stimulation of the vagus nerve to treat dementia might be more effective than stimulation of nerves found in locations such as the spine forehead and earlobes Cameron M H Lonergan E Lee H. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation TENS for dementia. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2003 Issue 3. Art. No. CD004032. 2009 update . The method of using vagal nerve stimulation to treat AD had been disclosed earlier in U.S. Pat. No. 5 269 303 entitled Treatment of dementia by nerve stimulation to WERNICKE et al. but neither that patent nor the clinical trials proposed any physiological intermediary through which vagal nerve stimulation may result in clinical improvement to AD patients.

It has been proposed that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve may attenuate an inflammatory response. In particular methods involving electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve have been disclosed for attenuating or inhibiting the release of the pro inflammatory cytokine TNF alpha including AD as one disease in a long list of diseases involving inflammation U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 610 713 and 6 838 471 entitled Inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production by cholinergic agonists and vagus nerve stimulation to TRACEY Kevin J. TRACEY. The inflammatory reflex. Nature 420 2002 853 859 Kevin J. TRACEY. Physiology and immunology of the cholinergic anti inflammatory pathway. J. Clin. Invest. 117 2007 289 296 . It has also been proposed that electrical stimulation of nerves of the sympathetic nervous system particularly the splenic nerve may also attenuate an inflammatory response by attenuating or inhibiting the release of TNF alpha including AD as a one disease in a long list of diseases involving inflammation U.S. Pat. No. 7 769 442 entitled Device and method for inhibiting release of pro inflammatory mediator to SHAFER . PROLO et al. noted the above mention vagal nerve stimulation investigations and predicted that interventions based on attenuation of inflammation would be useful for the treatment of AD Paolo PROLO Francesco Chiappelli Alberto Angeli Andrea Dovio Maria Luisa Sartori Fausto Fanto Negoita Neagos Ercolano Manfrini. Putative Neurolmmune Mechanisms in Alzheimer s Disease Modulation by Cholinergic Anti Inflammatory Reflex CAIR . International Journal of Integrative Biology 2007 Vol 1 No. 2 88 95 .

However as noted above TNF alpha is involved in more than inflammation in AD Ian A. CLARK Lisa M. Alleva and Bryce Vissel. The roles of TNF in brain dysfunction and disease. Pharmacology Therapeutics 128 Issue 3 December 2010 519 548 . It is also a gliotransmitter that regulates synaptic function in neural networks Gertrudis PEREA and Alfonso Araque. GLIA modulates synaptic transmission. Brain Research Reviews. 63 Issues 1 2 May 2010 93 102 . In that capacity TNF alpha has been shown to mediate the disruption in synaptic memory mechanisms. None of the above mentioned citations have proposed that stimulation of the vagus nerve modulates the capacity of TNF alpha to function as a gliotransmitter which can be released from any glial cell including oligodendrocytes astrocytes and microglia. Such modulation in capacity can be due to a change in the amount of TNF alpha or in the activity of a given amount of TNF alpha or in the activity of the cells between which TNF related gliotransmission occurs. In fact the above mentioned citations are concerned only with the attenuation or inhibition of the release of TNF alpha as a pro inflammatory mediator but not with its degradation or modification or with changes in its activity for a given amount.

Stimulation of the vagus nerve may also antagonize the pro inflammatory capabilities of TNF alpha and other pro inflammatory cytokines through mechanisms that are different from those proposed by TRACEY and colleagues. In particular it has been observed that stimulation of the vagus nerve may enhance the release of retinoic acid RA from nerve locations that produce RA from retinaldehyde using retinaldehyde dehydrogenases van de PAVERT S A Olivier B J Goverse G Vondenhoff M F Greuter M Beke P Kusser K H pken U E Lipp M Niederreither K Blomhoff R Sitnik K Agace W W Randall T D de Jonge W J Mebius R E. Chemokine CXCL13 is essential for lymph node initiation and is induced by retinoic acid and neuronal stimulation. Nat Immunol. 10 11 2009 1193 1199 . The retinoic acid so released may directly inhibit the release or functioning of proinflammatory cytokines which would be an anti pro inflammatory mechanism that is distinct from the one proposed by TRACEY and colleagues Malcolm Maden. Retinoic acid in the development regeneration and maintenance of the nervous system. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 8 2007 755 765 . Because RA strongly suppresses the production of IL6 inhibits amyloid beta induced TNF alpha production and inhibits expression of inducible NO synthase iNOS in activated microglia the release of RA following stimulation of the vagus nerve will also serve to inhibit inflammation K. SHUDO H. Fukasawa M. Nakagomi and N. Yamagata. Towards Retinoid Therapy for Alzheimer s Disease. Current Alzheimer Research 2009 6 302 311 . Retinoic acid can also regulate the expression of the tau protein and in particular the level of phosphorylated forms of tau Andrea MALASPINA and Adina T. Michael Titus. Is the modulation of retinoid and retinoid associated signaling a future therapeutic strategy in neurological trauma and neurodegeneration J. Neurochem. 2008 104 584 595 . Furthermore stimulation of nerves to release retinoic acid or activate its receptors may also promote the clearance of beta amyloids in AD by RA activation of the heterodimeric complex formed by PPAR RXR Camacho I. E. Serneels L. Spittaels K. Merchiers P. Dominguez D. and De Strooper B. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma induces a clearance mechanism for the amyloid beta peptide. J. Neurosci. 24 2004 10908 10917 .

The cytokine TGF beta acts in a highly contextual manner and depending on cell type and environment TGF beta may promote cell survival or induce apoptosis stimulate cell proliferation or induce differentiation and initiate or resolve inflammation. In the presence of RA TGF beta is biased towards anti inflammation so the release of RA following vagal nerve stimulation may inhibit inflammation by that pro anti inflammatory mechanism as well Tony Wyss Coray. TGF beta Pathway as a Potential Target in Neurodegeneration and Alzheimer s. Current Alzheimer Research 3 2006 191 195 . Treating the patient with oral retinoic acid may also promote an anti inflammatory bias for TGF beta. Furthermore vagal nerve stimulation may also stimulate the production of the TGF beta that can act as an anti inflammatory agent CORCORAN Ciaran Connor Thomas J O Keane Veronica Garland Malcolm R.

TGF beta is a member of the TGF beta superfamily of neurotrophic factors. Neurotrophic factors serve as growth factors for the development maintenance repair and survival of specific neuronal populations acting via retrograde signaling from target neurons by paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. Nerve growth factor NGF is the most widely examined neurotrophin in experimental models of AD and of all the factors tested NGF appears to be the most effective in improving the survival and maintenance of cholinergic neurons. It is therefore considered to be a promising therapeutic agent for AD Yossef S. LEVY Yossi Gilgun Sherki Eldad Melamed and Daniel Offen. Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors in Neurodegenerative Diseases. Biodrugs 2005 19 2 97 127 Mark H. TUSZYNSKI. Nerve Growth Factor Gene Therapy in Alzheimer Disease. Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord 21 2 2007 179 189 . However major problems in using neurotrophic factors for therapy are their inability to cross blood brain barrier adverse effects resulting from binding to the receptor in other organs of the body and their low diffusion rate.

It is known that vagal nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation can increase the levels of at least one neurotrophic factor in the brain brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF which has been studied extensively in connection with the treatment of depression. However it has never been suggested that vagal nerve stimulation may be utilized to increase BDNF levels in AD patients. BDNF is known to be reduced in AD brains and the introduction of BDNF into the brain of animal models of AD promotes regeneration Alan H NAGAHARA et al. Neuroprotective effects of brain derived neurotrophic factor in rodent and primate models of Alzheimer s disease. Nat Med. 15 March 2009 331 337 . Vagal nerve stimulation may likewise promote the expression of other neurotrophic factors such as NGF which circumvents the problem of blood brain barrier blockage Follesa P Biggio F Gorini G Caria S Talani G Dazzi L Puligheddu M Marrosu F Biggio G. Vagus nerve stimulation increases norepinephrine concentration and the gene expression of BDNF and bFGF in the rat brain.

Patent application US20100280562 entitled Biomarkers for monitoring treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases to PI et al disclosed the measurement of BDNF following vagal nerve stimulation. However that application is concerned with the search for biomarkers involving the levels of BDNF rather than a method for treating a neurodegenerative disease using vagal nerve stimulation.

Magnetic stimulation of AD patients has been performed but its use has been intended to affect cognitive skills using transcranial magnetic stimulation Mamede de Carvalho Alexandre de Mendon a Pedro C.

Accordingly methods are disclosed here to treat AD patients preferably as part of a multi target therapy. The foregoing review of AD disclosed six novel mechanisms by which stimulation of the vagus nerve may be used to treat AD 1 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to enhance the availability or effectiveness of TGF beta or other anti inflammatory cytokines 2 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to enhance the availability or effectiveness of retinoic acid 3 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to promote the expression of the neurotrophic factors such as BDNF 4 stimulate the vagus nerve to modulate the capacity of TNF alpha to function as a gliotransmitter including modulating the activity of the cells between which TNF related gliotransmission occurs 5 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to suppress the release or effectiveness of pro inflammatory cytokines through a mechanism that is distinct from the one proposed by TRACEY and colleagues 6 stimulate the vagus nerve to modulate the degradation of TNF alpha and or modify the activity of existing TNF alpha molecules as a pro inflammatory mediator.

In the preferred embodiment the method stimulates the vagus nerve as indicated in using the toroidal magnetic stimulation device that is disclosed herein. The position and angular orientation of the device are adjusted about that location until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator coils. The applied current is increased gradually first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The power is then increased but is set to a level that is less than one at which the patient first indicates any discomfort. Straps harnesses or frames are used to maintain the stimulator in position not shown in or . The stimulator signal may have a frequency and other parameters that are selected to influence the therapeutic result. For example a pulse width may be from about 0.01 ms to 500.0 ms typically 200 ms. The pulses may be delivered at a frequency of 0.5 to 500 Hz. typically 20 Hz. The stimulation may be performed for 1 to 200 minutes typically for 30 minutes. Typically the treatment is performed repeatedly e.g. once a week for six months. However parameters of the stimulation may be varied in order to obtain a beneficial response as indicated for example by the measurement of levels and or activities of TGF beta neurotrophic factors retinoic acid and or TNF alpha in the patient s peripheral circulation and or in the patient s cerebrospinal fluid during and subsequent to each treatment.

Parkinson s disease PD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by problems with movement particularly tremor at rest slowness of gait joint and muscle rigidity and unstable posture. The disease is also commonly accompanied by cognitive autonomic and sensory dysfunctions. PD symptoms result from dopamine insufficiency in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and other portions of the midbrain. In PD neuromelanin pigmented dopamine secreting neurons in those regions die at locations where there is an abnormal accumulation and aggregation of misfolded alpha synuclein protein in the form of so called Lewy bodies.

Definite diagnosis of PD is made only at autopsy with a finding of substantial nerve cell depletion with accompanying gliosis in the substantia nigra of at least one Lewy body in the substantia nigra or in the locus coeruleus and of no pathological evidence for other diseases that produce symptoms of Parkinsonism. Diagnosis of PD based upon symptoms alone is considered to be only probable with up to 20 of the probable PD diagnoses not confirmed after autopsy. The onset and progression of probable PD in an individual is commonly quantified using a scoring device known as the Unified Parkinson s Disease Rating Scale UPDRS which incorporates considerations used to diagnose PD. The scoring of symptoms follows standard neurological examination practice in which finding of the following contribute to the diagnosis of PD tremor especially if more pronounced at rest slowing of motion and muscle rigidity onset of symptoms on only one side of the body and improvement with administration of levodopa J JANKOVIC.

Movement Disorder Society Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson s Disease Rating Scale MDS UPDRS Scale Presentation and Clinimetric Testing Results. Movement Disorders 23 No. 15 2008 2129 2170 .

Currently there are no laboratory tests that can confirm a neurological diagnosis of probable PD. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid tests of PD patients are often normal electroencephalography is not able to detect PD and the MRI and CAT scans of PD patients appear normal. However experimental biomarkers for diagnosing PD are available A. W. Michell S. J. G. Lewis T. Foltynie and R. A. Barker. Biomarkers and Parkinson s disease. Brain 2004 127 1693 1705 Manuel B. Graeber. Biomarkers for Parkinson s disease. Experimental Neurology 216 2009 249 253 . PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer s disease and is the most common movement disorder. Some movement disorders resemble PD but belong to a more general category of disorder referred to as Parkinsonian syndrome or Parkinsonism. Other movement disorders may involve neurodegeneration at some point in their pathogenesis including multiple system atrophy progressive supranuclear palsy corticobasal degeneration tremor dystonia including torticollis spasmodic dysphonia and blepharospasm restless leg syndrome tic and Tourette syndrome chorea spasticity and tardive dyskinesia. It is understood that the methods disclosed herein for the treatment of PD may be used to treat such other movement disorders as well.

PD usually appears in people between 40 and 70 years of age with the incidence of PD peaking in people in their sixties. More than one million individuals in the North America have PD and in industrialized societies greater than 1 of the population over the age of 65 years have the disease. Increasing age beyond 60 years is a strong risk factor for PD. Currently there is no clear evidence that PD is found preferentially in a particular sex or geographical location. Exposure to the neurotoxin MPTP causes permanent symptoms that are similar to those in PD and exposure to toxic chemicals such as pesticides e.g. rotenone herbicides e.g. paraquat and fungicides e.g. maneb greatly increase the risk of developing PD. Only 5 15 of the cases of PD are related to the patient having a predisposing gene but some such genes lead to early onset PD. Use of tobacco coffee non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blocker drugs have been found to protect against PD. Lonneke M L DELAU Monique M B Breteler. Epidemiology of Parkinson s disease. Lancet Neurol 5 2006 525 35 SHIN J. H. V. L. Dawson T. M. Dawson SnapShot Parkinson s disease pathogenesis. Cell 139 2009 440 440 .

BRAAK and colleagues present evidence that PD ordinarily begins in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve in the medulla and not in the midbrain dopaminergic neurons as has been generally assumed. Furthermore since this site is connected to the periphery by the vagus nerve they propose that toxic factors enters the central nervous system via the vagus nerve and the pathological process then progresses up the neuroaxis during which components of the olfactory autonomic limbic and somatomotor systems become progressively involved BRAAK H Bohl J R Muller C M Rub U de Vos R A Del Tredici K. Stanley Fahn Lecture 2005 The staging procedure for the inclusion body pathology associated with sporadic Parkinson s disease reconsidered. Mov Disord 2006 21 12 2042 51 . Accordingly methods for preventing or treating PD are to stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to prevent toxins environmental toxin virus or alpha synuclein clusters from reaching the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve to serve as an antidote to toxins that have already reached that location and to prevent the pathology from progressing up the neuroaxis.

The pathophysiological origins of dopaminergic nerve depletion in the substantia nigra of PD patients are thought to involve mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative and nitrosative stress and impairment of the ubiquitinproteasome system UPS and the autophagy lysosome pathway ALP with attendant aberrant protein handling. Nerve depletion occurs in dopamine producing cells of the substantia nigra because those cell are uniquely susceptible to damage as a result of their high energy requirements and their expression of a unique Cav 1.3 calcium channel protein. The calcium channel protein causes sustained elevations in cytosolic calcium concentration particularly in dendrites which stimulates mitochondrial respiratory metabolism and generates reactive oxygen species ROS . Generation of ROS or damage from environmental toxins leads to inhibition of the first enzyme complex of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain mitochondrial complex I . For example the Parkinson producing toxin MPTP specifically inhibits mitochondrial complex I. This leads to eventual depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. A by product of such mitochondrial impairment is increased production of more ROS producing a vicious cycle of more oxidative damage within the neurons of PD patients Chan C S Guzman J N Ilijic E Mercer J N Rick C Tkatch T Meredith G E Surmeier D J 2007 Rejuvenation protects neurons in mouse models of Parkinson s disease. Nature 447 1081 1086 .

Alpha synuclein alpha SN is a cytoplasmic protein that is highly expressed in dopaminergic neuronal cells and that interacts with pre synaptic membranes suggesting that its function is to regulate synaptic vesicle pools including control of dopamine levels. As noted above alpha SN deposits in the form of Lewy Bodies are a defining characteristic of PD. Oxidation and nitration of alpha SN in the environment of dysfunctional mitochondria lead to the formation of alpha SN aggregates and the stabilization of assembled alpha SN filaments. Such abnormal alpha SN might also damage mitochondria directly contributing to even greater oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The conversion of alpha SN from soluble monomers to aggregated amyloid like insoluble forms is a key event in PD pathogenesis.

Protein mishandling due to dysfunction in the ubiquitinproteasome system UPS and the autophagy lysosome pathway ALP are major pathways leading to neuronal degeneration in PD. The UPS pathway targets and rapidly destroy misfolded proteins in cells through attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins. The ubiquitin tag serves as a signal for their degradation by a proteasome which is an abundant ATP dependent protease. The second pathway is autophagy which is a catabolic process involving the degradation of a cell s own components through lysosomal machinery. It comprises several types macroautophagy microautophagy and chaperone mediated autophagy. Although the UPS and ALP pathways may clear damaged cell components in early stages of PD eventually they may themselves become damaged and contribute to the progression of PD.

Abnormal alpha SN is thought to cause UPS dysfunction through binding and inhibiting the 20 26S proteasome and abnormal or aggregated forms of alpha SN may also overwhelm the degradative capacity of the proteasome leading to UPS impairment beyond that which is attributable to oxidation of UPS components.

Once the UPS has become dysfunctional autophagy is upregulated as a compensatory mechanism for degrading aggregated misfolded and abnormal proteins. However lysosomal malfunction has been found to accompany alpha SN aggregation supporting the view that ALP dysfunction is an important mechanism of neurodegeneration. Furthermore dysfunction of the ALP is thought to occur naturally as a consequence of aging so that clearance of aggregating alpha SN might fail in the cells of elderly individuals irrespective of whether the abnormal alpha SN promotes ALP dysfunction.

Autophagy has a dual role to promote cell survival through removal of abnormal cellular components and to promote cell death when intracellular damage is beyond repair. Inappropriate or prolonged activation of autophagy may therefore lead to the complete death and destruction of some cells in PD. Other mechanisms for the death of the defective dopamine producing cells include caspase dependent and caspase independent pathways endoplasmic reticulum stress neuronal nitric oxide synthase nNOS activation DNA damage poly ADP ribose polymerase PARP activation and GAPDH modification Dale E. BREDESEN Rammohan V. Rao and Patrick Mehlen. Cell death in the nervous system. Nature 443 7113 2006 796 802 Tianhong PAN Seiji Kondo Weidong Le Joseph Jankovic. The role of autophagy lysosome pathway in neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson s disease. Brain 131 2008 1969 1978 .

Another mechanism leading to the death of dopamine producing cells in PD is inflammatory through microglial activation. The activation begins with microglia detecting stimulatory signaling molecules such as the active form of MMP 3 alpha SN and neuromelanin that have leaked from intact cells or that are extracellular after the destruction of dopamine producing cells by mechanisms that were described above. Activated microglia cause dopamine neuronal degeneration either by superoxide NO and other proinflammatory cytokines or by direct phagocytosis against neurons that are in the process of becoming dysfunctional or even normal bystander neurons. Products derived from microglia and astrocytes act in a combinatorial manner to promote neurotoxicity. The inflammatory response becomes a vicious cycle because additional microglial activating factors are leaked or released from the cells that are attacked during the inflammation Kim Y S Joh T H.

Neutralizing the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor TNF alpha has been found to reduce nigral degeneration in an animal model of PD. Melissa K. McCOY Terina N. Martinez Kelly A. Ruhn David E. Szymkowski Christine G. Smith Barry R. Botterman Keith E. Tansey and Malu G. Tansey. Blocking Soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor Signaling with Dominant Negative Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitor Attenuates Loss of Dopaminergic Neurons in Models of Parkinson s Disease.

Nos. 6 610 713 and 6 838 471 entitled Inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production by cholinergic agonists and vagus nerve stimulation to TRACEY also suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha by vagal nerve stimulation. The methods described in those patents might therefore substitute for the anti TNF treatment that was used by McCOY and colleagues. However there is no mention or suggestion that the methods described in those patents are intended to modulate the activity of anti inflammatory cytokines such as TGF beta or to antagonize TNF alpha by some other mechanism. One such mechanism involves the release of retinoic acid from cells Malcolm Maden. Retinoic acid in the development regeneration and maintenance of the nervous system. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 8 2007 755 765 and is discussed below.

Under normal physiologic conditions microglia are maintained quiescent by the coordinate action of neurons and astrocytes.

The orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 also inhibits expression of proinflammatory neurotoxic mediators in microglia and astrocytes.

This implicates retinoic acid in the response to inflammatory and other damage through the following mechanism. Retinoic acid acts by binding to heterodimers of the retinoic acid receptor RAR and the retinoid X receptor RXR which then bind to retinoic acid response elements RAREs to activate transcription in the regulatory regions of target survival and repair genes. Retinoic acid signaling is also involved in normal nigrostriatal functioning as evidenced by the fact that disulphiram which blocks the synthesis of retinoic acid induces Parkinsonism by producing lesions. The dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system contain high levels of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase that generate retinoic acid in the axon terminals which in turn acts on neurotransmission in an autocrine fashion or on the striatal cells in a paracrine fashion Malcolm Maden. Retinoic acid in the development regeneration and maintenance of the nervous system Nature Reviews Neuroscience 8 2007 755 765 .

TGF beta is a member of the TGF beta superfamily of neurotrophic factors. Neurotrophic factors serve as growth factors for the development maintenance repair and survival of specific neuronal populations acting via retrograde signaling from target neurons by paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. Other neurotrophic factors such as glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor GDNF and neurturin also strongly promote the survival of dopamine producing neurons. However major problems in using neurotrophic factors for therapy are their inability to cross blood brain barrier adverse effects resulting from binding to the receptor in other organs of the body and their low diffusion rate. A recently discovered neurotrophic factor mesencephalic astrocyte derived neurotrophic factor MANF is able to diffuse more rapidly but is also unable to cross the blood brain barrier Yossef S.

However it is known that vagal nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation can increase the levels of at least one neurotrophic factor in the brain brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF which has been studied extensively in connection with the treatment of depression. It is therefore possible that vagal nerve stimulation may likewise promote the expression of the neurotrophic factors such as GDNF and MANF that are known to promote the survival of dopamine producing cells in PD thereby circumventing the problem of blood brain barrier blockage Follesa P Biggio F Gorini G Caria 5 Talani G Dazzi L Puligheddu M Marrosu F Biggio G.

Patent application US20100280562 entitled Biomarkers for monitoring treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases to PI et al disclosed the measurement of GDNF following vagal nerve stimulation. However that application is concerned with the search for biomarkers involving the levels of GDNF rather than a method for treating a neurodegenerative disease using vagal nerve stimulation.

It is known that the levels of BDNF are rapidly regulated by sensory input during development and in adulthood particularly the presence or absence of bright light Eero CASTREN Francisco Zafra Hans Thoenen and Dan Lindholm. Light regulates expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in rat visual cortex. Proc. Nad. Acad. Sci. USA 89 1992 9444 9448 . The levels of other neurotrophic factors may also be regulated by sensory input. Accordingly it may be possible to enhance the effect of vagal nerve stimulation on the levels of neurotrophic factors by simultaneously presenting the waveform of the vagal nerve stimulation to the patient by a second route in the form of bright light that is fluctuating in intensity with the vagal stimulation waveform. The bright light waveform may be presented without any delay or it may be presented after a delay such that the vagal and light waveforms can best entrain one another within the patient s brain. Considering that bright light therapy and vagal nerve stimulation are established treatments for depression such a novel combined therapy may be most successful for treating depression. However bright light therapy has also been used successfully to treat PD and its success with PD patients may be attributable to the regulation of neurotrophic factors in addition to BDNF Sebastian Paus Tanja Schmitz Hubsch Ullrich Wullner Antje Vogel Thomas Klockgether and Michael Abele. Bright Light Therapy in Parkinson s Disease A Pilot Study. Movement Disorders 22 10 2007 1495 1498 . It is understood that other forms of sensory input may also be used in place of or in addition to bright light e.g. audio or tactile input that is presented with the waveform of the vagal nerve stimulator.

To understand how PD symptoms of abnormal movement relate to dopaminergic nerve depletion in the substantia nigra it is necessary to appreciate how the substantia nigra connects functionally and neuroanatomically to regions of the brain that control movement. Basically dopaminergic depletion in PD disrupts corticostriatal neuroelectrical balance leading to increased activity in an indirect circuit and reduced activity in a direct circuit. Those imbalanced corticostriatal connections result in excessive thalamic inhibition which leads to suppression of the cortical motor system resulting in akinesia rigidity and tremor and inhibitory descending projection to brain stem locomotor areas contribute to abnormalities of gait and posture Lang A E Lozano A M. Parkinson s disease. Second of two parts. N Engl J Med 339 No. 16 1998 1130 1143 OBESO JA Rodr guez Oroz M C Benitez Temino B et al. Functional organization of the basal ganglia therapeutic implications for Parkinson s disease. Mov. Disord. 23 Suppl 3 2008 S548 59 . That understanding provides a rationale for the PD treatments involving deep brain stimulation or ablation that are summarized below.

Currently there is no cure for PD but therapies are available to treat its symptoms and retard its progression. The drug levodopa L DOPA is the most commonly used treatment. It is transformed into dopamine in dopaminergic neurons and therefore compensates for the lack of dopamine in the substantia nigra. Because L DOPA may be metabolized before crossing the blood brain barrier its metabolite s may cause significant side effects by virtue of their effects outside the brain. Therefore peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitors carbidopa and benserazide are often co administered with L DOPA to reduce the side effects. Furthermore administered L DOPA inhibits the endogenous formation of dopamine so its administration eventually becomes counterproductive such that the PD patient exhibits periods of unresponsiveness to L DOPA the so called off periods . At that point dopamine agonists may be administered which activate dopamine receptors even in the absence of dopamine. The dopamine agonists include bromocriptine pergolide pramipexole ropinirole piribedil cabergoline apomorphine and lisuride. In late PD they are useful for reducing the off periods. They may also be administered as an initial treatment depending on the age of the patient before using L DOPA. In lieu of dopamine agonists MAO B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline may also be administered. They increase dopamine levels by inhibiting the rate at which dopamine is degraded.

Excessive muscle contraction in PD occurs when cholinergic function which increases muscle contraction is more powerful than dopaminergic function which decreases muscle contraction . Anti muscarinics reduce cholinergic function and are therefore sometimes prescribed to bring about more balanced muscular contraction.

Deep brain stimulation DBS is currently performed on patients whose PD symptoms cannot be controlled by medication and patients for whom the medications produce unacceptable side effects. DBS is a surgical procedure that electrically stimulates the brain at the sites of implanted electrodes most often in subthalamic nucleus the globus pallidus internus or the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus. The battery powered neurostimulator to which the electrodes are attached may be turned off making DBS effectively reversible in contrast to irreversible surgical ablation pallidotomy at those sites of the brain. Experimental stimulators may also turn themselves off but stimulate only when the onset of tremors is detected by the device. Use of DBS makes it possible for the PD patients to reduce their medications thereby also reducing side effects from them. Complications from DBS include those associated with the surgery itself bleeding reaction to anesthesia infection and cable breakage and migration as well as problems resulting from the stimulation e.g. cognitive problems numbness double vision etc. that cannot be corrected by adjusting stimulation parameters GARCIA L.

Vagal nerve stimulation has been performed on one PD patient who also had epilepsy. When the stimulation intensity was insufficient to control epileptic seizure the PD symptoms nevertheless improved resting tremor resolved bradiykinesia improved and the UPDRS score decreased to from 22 to 16. However the mechanism of that improvement was not addressed. Furthermore considering that the stimulation parameters were those that had been optimized to treat epilepsy it is likely that other stimulation parameters may be more suitable for the treatment of PD S.

Other forms of non invasive stimulation are commonly used to treat the motor dysfunction of PD patients repetetive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS and electroconvulsive therapy ECT . These methods stimulate the brain directly rather stimulate the vagus nerve F FREGNI D K Simon A Wu A Pascual Leone.

The foregoing review of PD disclosed six novel mechanisms by which stimulation of the vagus nerve may be used to treat PD 1 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to prevent toxins environmental toxin virus or alpha synuclein clusters from reaching the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve to serve as an antidote to toxins that have already reached that location and to prevent the pathology from progressing up the neuroaxis 2 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to enhance the availability or effectiveness of TGF beta or other anti inflammatory cytokines 3 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to enhance the availability or effectiveness of retinoic acid 4 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to suppress the release or effectiveness of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha through a mechanism that is distinct from the one proposed by TRACEY and colleagues 5 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to promote the expression of the neurotrophic factors such as GDNF and MANF and 6 present bright light to the patient in such a way that the light varies in intensity with the same waveform as the vagal nerve stimulation waveform.

Embodiments of the invention in which toxins are prevented from affecting the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and other locations along the neuroaxis are like embodiments described below for treating PD at or near the substantia nigra except that parameters of the stimulation current frequency pulse width duty cycle etc. are chosen in such a way as to preferentially treat the selected neuroanatomical locations

Thus in one embodiment of the invention the vagus nerve in such a way as to enhance the availability or effectiveness of TGF beta or other anti inflammatory cytokines. In a related embodiment of the invention vagal nerve stimulation promotes release of neuron synthesized retinoic acid. In another embodiment of the invention patients may be co treated with all trans retinoic acid ATRA wherein oral retinoic acid is first administered at a dose of 0.1 to 200 mg sq. m typically 20 mg sq. m. If retinoic acid syndrome or other side effects are not observed in the patient ATRA is thereafter administered daily until vagal nerve stimulation is performed typically after one week of ATRA administration and no more than about 45 days of ATRA administration. It is understood that other retinoids such as 9 cis retinoic acid and 13 cis retinoic acid and any other agent that biases TGF towards its anti inflammatory potential may be substituted for ATRA and that if side effects are found a reduced dose may be administered ADAMSON P.

Oncol. 13 1238 1241 1995 .

In another embodiment of the invention the vagus nerve is stimulated in such a way as to promote the expression of the neurotrophic factors such as GDNF and MANF. This may be performed with or without the additional presentation of bright light to the patient in such a way that the light varies in intensity with the same waveform as the vagal nerve stimulation waveform. If co treatment with light is performed the luminance is greater than 2500 lux typically 7500 lux. The light source preferentially produces white or short wavelength light such as blue light. Furthermore output of light from the light source follows the supply of energy to the light source such that when power is supplied or removed the light rapidly appears or disappears without any significant lag. In the preferred embodiment the light source comprises light emitting diodes LEDs . In another embodiment of the invention the vagus nerve in such a way as to suppress the release or effectiveness of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha via anti inflammatory cytokine retinoic acid and neurotrophic pathways.

In the preferred embodiment of treating PD the method stimulates the vagus nerve as indicated in using the magnetic stimulation devices that are disclosed herein. The position and angular orientation of the device are adjusted about that location until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator coils. The applied current is increased gradually first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The power is then increased but is set to a level that is less than one at which the patient first indicates any discomfort. Straps harnesses or frames are used to maintain the stimulator in position not shown in or . The stimulator signal may have a frequency and other parameters that are selected to influence the therapeutic result. For example a pulse width may be from about 0.01 ms to 500.0 ms typically 200 ms. The pulses may be delivered at a frequency of 0.5 to 500 Hz typically 20 Hz. The stimulation may be performed for 1 to 200 minutes typically for 30 minutes. Typically the treatment is performed repeatedly e.g. once a month for six months. However parameters of the stimulation may be varied in order to obtain a beneficial response as indicated for example by the measuring levels and or activities of anti inflammatory cytokines pro inflammatory cytokines retinoic acid and or neurotrophic factors in the patient s peripheral circulation and or in the patient s cerebrospinal fluid and or tissue before during or subsequent to each treatment. A beneficial response may also be determined through use of standard diagnosis and treatment evaluation tools for PD such as the Unified Parkinson s Disease Rating Scale UPDRS .

Myelin is a dielectric material that forms a natural layer sheath around the axon of certain neurons. The presence of a myelin sheath increases the speed at which electrical impulses propagate along those axons through a process known as saltation. Myelin is composed of about 80 lipid principally galactocerebroside and sphingomyelin and about 20 protein principally myelin basic protein myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and proteolipid protein . Myelin is formed and maintained by Schwann cells for axons within the peripheral nervous system and by interfascicular oligodendrocytes for axons within the central nervous system.

Demyelination is the loss of myelin sheaths around axons. It is the primary cause of a category of neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases in which the immune system pathologically damages the nervous system by destroying myelin. These demyelinating diseases include multiple sclerosis acute disseminated encephalomyelitis transverse myelitis chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Guillain Barr Syndrome central pontine myelinosis leukodystrophy and Charcot Marie Tooth disease. In what follows methods of treating multiple sclerosis MS are disclosed but it is understood that the disclosure applies also to other demyelinating neurodegenerative diseases.

MS has no generally accepted formal definition so that a large number of so called idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases also known as borderline forms of MS may also be treated by the disclosed methods to the extent that autoimmunity is involved in their pathophysiology e.g. optic spinal MS Devic s disease acute disseminated encephalomyelitis Balo concentric sclerosis Schilder disease Marburg MS tumefactive MS pediatric and pubertal MS and venous MS . To that same extent the disclosed methods would also apply to dysmyelination disease viz. diseases involving the formation of defective myelin without the formation of plaques including leukodystrophies Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease Canavan disease phenylketonuria and schizophrenia.

In MS nerves of the brain and spinal cord not only become demyelinated but there is also scarring formation of scleroses also known as plaques or lesions of the nervous tissue particularly in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord which is mainly composed of myelin. The neurons in white matter carry signals between grey matter areas of the central nervous system where information processing is performed and the rest of the body. In MS the demyelination is found only rarely in the peripheral nervous system COMPSTON A and Coles A. Multiple sclerosis. Lancet 372 9648 October 2008 1502 1517 .

The destruction of myelin takes place concomitantly with destruction of the oligodendrocytes that are responsible for the formation and maintenance of myelin sheaths. As the body s own immune system attacks and damages the myelin myelin sheaths are damaged or lost and axons can no longer effectively conduct signals. The inability to conduct nerve signals leads to symptoms that correspond to the particular nervous tissue that has been damaged Kenneth J. SMITH and W. I. McDonald. The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis the mechanisms underlying the production of symptoms and the natural history of the disease. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 1999 Oct. 29 354 1390 1649 1673 .

Because the demyelination can occur essentially anywhere in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord the MS patient can initially exhibit almost any neurological symptom making an initial diagnosis of MS difficult. Such symptoms include impairment of the central nervous system fatigue depression and moodiness or cognitive dysfunction visual problems inflammation of the optic nerve double vision or involuntary eye movement inability to articulate or swallow muscle problems weakness spasm or lack of coordination sensation problems pain insensitivity tingling prickliness or numbness bowel problems constipation diarrhea or incontinence and urinary problems incontinence overactive bladder or retention . In order of frequency the most common initial MS symptoms are changes in sensation vision loss weakness double vision unsteady walking and imbalance. Fifteen percent of MS patients have multiple initial symptoms.

Following the initial symptoms a period of months to years of remission may elapse. Thereafter acute periods of relapse may occur followed by another remission or a gradual deterioration of neurologic function. New symptoms may also arise during each relapse. Progression of the disease is heterogeneous among MS patients and subtypes of MS are recognized based upon the regularity of the acute relapse and subsequent remission the magnitude of the relapse and the extent to which progressive deterioration occurs between acute relapses. The most common pattern of MS is known as relapsing remitting MS RRMS in which unpredictable acute relapses may sometimes produce little or no lasting symptoms followed by periods of no change followed by another relapse etc. RRMS usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome CIS attack that only suggests MS which develops into MS in only 30 to 70 percent of CIS patients.

Standard diagnostic tools for MS are neuroimaging analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. The neuroimaging includes the use of MRI to show plaque location. The analysis of cerebrospinal fluid measures factors that would indicate the presence of chronic inflammation. The evoked potentials comprise neural stimulation that seeks to determine the existence of a reduced neural response that would indicate demyelination.

Many potential triggers of MS acute relapses have been examined but only a few of them are often acknowledged as being likely triggers such as the season of the year spring and summer viral infection and stress.

Epidemiological studies have also examined the likelihood that an individual will ever have MS. More than 300 thousand individuals suffer from MS in North America. Worldwide incidence of MS is significantly higher at locations closer to the north and south poles. Migration studies show that if the exposure to a higher risk environment occurs before the age of 15 years the migrant assumes the higher risk of the earlier environment. Epidemics of MS have been reported most notably in the Faroe Islands but no causative agent has been identified.

The disease onset usually occurs in young adulthood peaking between the ages of 20 and 30 and it is 1.4 to 3.1 times more common in females than males. Known genetic variations predispose an individual to have MS with Caucasian populations being at greater risk than Asian or African populations. Although there is a tendency for MS to run in families only 35 of monozygotic twins both have MS. Some environmental factors also increase the risk of MS such as decreased exposure to sunlight and infection with the Epstein Barr virus at a young age. However there is no set of risk factors that can reliably predict the onset of MS.

It is generally recognized that MS is an autoimmune disease in which T cells of the immune system gain entrance to the brain when the blood brain barrier BBB is compromised leading to inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. A deficiency in uric acid is implicated in compromise of the BBB and individuals with elevated uric acid e.g. gout patients are at decreased risk of developing MS. The T cells recognize myelin as foreign and attack it triggering inflammatory processes and stimulating other immune cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and antibodies. Myelinating oligodendrocytes either mature or derived from stem cells can repair some of the demyelination but if the inflammation is prolonged or frequent the damage eventually becomes unrepairable and a scarring sclerosis accumulates around the demyelinated neurons. Furthermore the axons of the corresponding neurons may also be damaged probably by B Cells of the immune system.

There is no known cure for MS. The current therapeutic practice is to relieve symptoms during and between acute attacks and to attempt to reduce the likelihood of relapses thereby slowing progression of the disease. Symptomatic treatment involves administration of corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone to reduce inflammation during attacks. Other drugs are used to treat the symptoms of spasticity baclofen tizanidine diazepam clonazepam dantrolene optic neuritis methylprednisolone and oral steroids fatigue amantadine pemoline pain codeine trigeminal neuralgia carbamazepine and sexual dysfunction papaverine for men .

To prevent relapses the following drugs are currently used Interferon beta 1a interferon beta glatiramer acetate mitoxantrone and natalizumab. These interferons are anti viral proteins that may suppress the immune system. Mitoxantrone is also an immunosuppressant that suppresses the proliferation of T cells and B cells. Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the ability of inflammatory immune cells to attach to and pass through the cell layers lining the blood brain barrier by binding to the cellular adhesion molecule a4 integrin. Glatiramer acetate is an immunomodulator drug that shifts the population of T cells from pro inflammatory Th1 cells to regulatory Th2 cells by virtue of its resemblance to myelin basic protein. Each of these drugs produces significant side effects. For example glatiramer acetate and the interferon treatments produce irritation at the injection site. Interferons also produce flu like symptoms and may cause liver damage. Mitoxantrone may cause cardiotoxicity. Natalizumab may cause multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

Experimental treatments for MS include plasma exchange bone marrow transplantation potassium channel blockers to improve the conduction of nerve impulses the inducement of an immune attack against myelin destroying T cells vaccination and peptide therapy protein antigen feeding to release the protective cytokine TGF beta administration of TGF beta use of monoclonal antibodies to promote remyelination and various dietary therapies. Many such experimental treatments are motivated by experiments using an animal model of brain inflammation diseases including MS namely experimental allergic encephalomyelitis EAE HAFLER D A Kent S C Pietrusewicz M J Khoury S J Weiner H L and Fukaura H.

Patent application US20040249416 entitled Treatment of conditions through electrical modulation of the autonomic nervous system to YUN et al. mentions treatment of multiple sclerosis within a long list of diseases in connection with stimulation of the vagus and other nerves. However it makes no mention of modulating the activity of cytokines or neurotrophic factors.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 610 713 and 6 838 471 entitled Inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production by cholinergic agonists and vagus nerve stimulation to TRACEY mention treatment of multiple sclerosis within a long list of diseases in connection with the treatment of inflammation through stimulation of the vagus nerve. According to those patents Inflammation and other deleterious conditions . . . are often induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor TNF also known as TNF.alpha. or cachectin . . . The patents goes on to state that Proinflammatory cytokines are to be distinguished from anti inflammatory cytokines . . . which are not mediators of inflammation. It is clear from those patents that their objective is only to suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha. There is no mention or suggestion that the method is intended to stimulate the release of anti inflammatory cytokines and in fact the text quoted above disclaims a role for anti inflammatory cytokines as mediators of inflammation. Those patents make a generally unjustified dichotomy between pro and anti inflammatory cytokines by indicating that a cytokine could be one or the other but not both. In particular the patents make no mention of the cytokine TGF beta and there is no suggestion that the role of a cytokine in regards to its pro or anti inflammation competence may be inherently indeterminate or indefinite unless more information is provided about the presumed physiological environment in which the cytokine finds itself.

Treatment of multiple sclerosis is also mentioned within long lists of diseases in the following related applications to TRACEY and his colleague HUSTON wherein stimulation of the vagus nerve is intended to suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha US20060178703 entitled Treating inflammatory disorders by electrical vagus nerve stimulation to HUSTON et al.

The same observations made above in connection with U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 610 713 and 6 838 471 apply to those applications as well.

The present invention discloses methods for using vagal nerve stimulation to suppress inflammation. However unlike the patents and applications to TRACEY and to HUSTON the present invention discloses use of vagal nerve stimulation to increase the concentration or effectiveness of anti inflammatory cytokines. TRACEY et al do not consider the modulation of anti inflammatory cytokines to be part of the cholinergic anti inflammatory pathway that their method of vagal nerve stimulation is intended to activate. Thus they explain that activation of vagus nerve cholinergic signaling inhibits TNF tumor necrosis factor and other proinflammatory cytokine overproduction through immune a7 nicotinic receptor mediated mechanisms V. A. PAVLOV and K. J. Tracey. Controlling inflammation the cholinergic anti inflammatory pathway. Biochemical Society Transactions 34 2006 6 1037 1040 . In contrast anti inflammatory cytokines are said to be part of a different diffusible anti inflammatory network which includes glucocorticoids anti inflammatory cytokines and other humoral mediators CZURA C J Tracey K J. Autonomic neural regulation of immunity. J Intern Med. 257 2005 2 156 66 . Their disclaiming of a role for anti inflammatory cytokines as mediators of inflammation following stimulation of the vagus nerve may be due to a recognition that anti inflammatory cytokines e.g. TGF are produced constitutively while pro inflammatory cytokines e.g. TNF alpha are not but are instead induced. However anti inflammatory cytokines are inducible as well as constitutive so that for example an increase in the concentrations of potentially anti inflammatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta TGF can in fact be accomplished through stimulation of the vagus nerve R A BAUMGARTNER V A Deramo and M A Beaven.

In MS the strategy of inhibiting pro inflammatory cytokines rather than enhancing anti inflammatory cytokines might even be counterproductive. Thus blocking TNF alpha with the drug lenercept promotes and exacerbates MS attacks rather than delaying them which might be attributable in part to the fact that TNF alpha promotes remyelination and the proliferation of oligodendrocytes that perform the myelination.

TGF is currently used as an experimental treatment for multiple sclerosis MIRSHAFIEY A Mohsenzadegan M.TGF beta as a promising option in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Neuropharmacology. 56 2009 6 7 929 36 . In the method disclosed herein it is applied directly as a drug indirectly through stimulation of the vagus nerve without pharmacological administration to the patient or both directly and indirectly.

TGF converts undifferentiated T cells into regulatory T Treg cells that block autoimmunity. However in the presence of interleukin 6 TGF also causes the differentiation of T lymphocytes into proinflammatory IL 17 cytokine producing T helper 17 TH17 cells which promote autoimmunity and inflammation. Thus it is conceivable that an increase of TGF levels might actually cause or exacerbate inflammation rather than suppress it. Accordingly a step in the method that is disclosed here is to deter TGF from realizing its pro inflammatory potential by selecting electrical stimulation parameters that bias the potential of TGF towards anti inflammation and or by treating the patient with an agent such as the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid that is known to promote such an anti inflammatory bias MUCIDA D Park Y Kim G Turovskaya O Scott I Kronenberg M Cheroutre H.

In one embodiment of the invention endogenous retinoic acid that is produced and released by neurons themselves is used to produce the anti inflammatory bias. Thus it is known that vagal nerve stimulation may induce differentiation through release of retinoic acid that is produced in neurons from retinaldehyde by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases and the disclosed invention claims to induce anti inflammatory regulatory T cell Treg differentiation by this type of mechanism van de PAVERT S A Olivier B J Goverse G Vondenhoff M F Greuter M Beke P Kusser K H pken U E Lipp M Niederreither K Blomhoff R Sitnik K Agace W W Randall T D de Jonge W J Mebius R E. Chemokine CXCL13 is essential for lymph node initiation and is induced by retinoic acid and neuronal stimulation. Nat Immunol. 2009 November 10 11 1193 9 . It is understood that the methods that are disclosed here in connection with the treatment of MS may be applied to the treatment of other diseases that involve inflammation such as post operative ileus.

Thus the present invention comprises a pro anti inflammatory mechanism because it biases the competence of TGF beta towards that of an anti inflammatory cytokine. An increase in the concentrations of potentially anti inflammatory cytokines such as TGF can also be accomplished through stimulation of the vagus nerve which is also a pro anti inflammatory mechanism when TGF is biases towards anti inflammation CORCORAN Ciaran Connor Thomas 1 O Keane Veronica Garland Malcolm R. The effects of vagus nerve stimulation on pro and anti inflammatory cytokines in humans a preliminary report. Neuroimmunomodulation 12 5 2005 307 309 . As mentioned above inhibiting the pro inflammatory cytokine TNF alpha is considered to be counterproductive in MS patients there may be circumstances in which the inhibition of other pro inflammatory cytokines may be useful therapeutically. In that case stimulation of the vagus nerve in an attempt to produce the anti pro inflammatory response advocated by TRACEY and colleagues may be attempted. However an anti pro inflammatory response may be produced by another mechanism involving stimulation of the vagus nerve because as indicated above vagal nerve stimulation may result in the release of retinoic acid and the retinoic acid itself inhibits pro inflammatory cytokines Malcolm Maden. Retinoic acid in the development regeneration and maintenance of the nervous system. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 8 2007 755 765 .

The potentially anti inflammatory cytokine TGF beta is a member of the TGF beta superfamily of neurotrophic factors. Neurotrophic factors serve as growth factors for the development maintenance repair and survival of specific neuronal populations acting via retrograde signaling from target neurons by paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. Other neurotrophic factors also promote the survival of neurons during neurodegeneration. These include members of the nerve growth factor NGF superfamily the glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor GDNF family the neurokine superfamily and non neuronal growth factors such as the insulin like growth factors IGF family. However major problems in using such neurotrophic factors for therapy are their inability to cross the blood brain barrier adverse effects resulting from binding to the receptor in other organs of the body and their low diffusion rate Yossef S.

It is known that vagal nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation can increase the levels of at least one neurotrophic factor in the brain brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF which has been studied extensively in connection with the treatment of depression Follesa P Biggio F Gorini G Caria S Talani G Dazzi L Puligheddu M Marrosu F Biggio G.

Effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on serum brain derived neurotrophic factor in drug resistant depressed patients. Journal of Affective Disorders 91 2006 83 86 . It has never been proposed before the present disclosure that vagal nerve stimulation may be utilized to increase BDNF levels in MS patients. BDNF is known to reduce clinical inflammation and cell death in an animal model of MS Makar T K Trisler D Sura K T Sultana S Patel N Bever C T. Brain derived neurotrophic factor treatment reduces inflammation and apoptosis in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. J Neurol Sci. 270 1 2 2008 70 6 . Vagal nerve stimulation may likewise promote the expression of other beneficial neurotrophic factors as well which circumvents the problem of blood brain barrier blockage by being induced through vagal nerve stimulation. Patent application US20100280562 entitled Biomarkers for monitoring treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases to PI et al disclosed the measurement of BDNF following vagal nerve stimulation. However that application is concerned with the search for biomarkers involving the levels of BDNF rather than a method for treating a neurodegenerative disease using vagal nerve stimulation.

The foregoing review of MS disclosed four novel mechanisms by which stimulation of the vagus nerve may be used to treat MS 1 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to enhance the availability or effectiveness of TGF beta or other anti inflammatory cytokines 2 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to enhance the availability or effectiveness of retinoic acid 3 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to suppress the release or effectiveness of pro inflammatory cytokines through a mechanism that is distinct from the one proposed by TRACEY and colleagues 4 stimulate the vagus nerve in such a way as to promote the expression of the neurotrophic factors such as BDNF.

In one embodiment of the invention patients may be co treated with all trans retinoic acid ATRA wherein oral retinoic acid is first administered at a dose of 0.1 to 200 mg sq. m typically 20 mg sq. m. If retinoic acid syndrome or other side effects are not observed in the patient ATRA is thereafter administered daily until vagal nerve stimulation is performed typically after one week of ATRA administration and no more than about 45 days of ATRA administration. It is understood that other retinoids such as 9 cis retinoic acid and 13 cis retinoic acid and any other agent that biases TGF towards its anti inflammatory potential may be substituted for ATRA and that if side effects are found a reduced dose may be administered ADAMSON P.

Oncol. 13 1238 1241 1995 .

In another embodiment of the invention vagal nerve stimulation itself promotes release of neuron synthesized retinoic acid thereby inducing the differentiation undifferentiated T cells into anti inflammatory regulatory T cells Treg in the presence of the cytokine TGF beta. In yet another embodiment of the invention both endogenous induced by vagal nerve stimulation and exogenous retinoic acid administered as a drug are used to induce differentiation of undifferentiated T cells into regulatory T Treg cells. Other aspects of the invention are that TGF beta itself may be induced by the vagal nerve stimulation the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha may be blocked by the vagal nerve stimulation and neurotrophic factors such as BDNF may be induced by the vagal nerve stimulation.

In the preferred embodiment of treating MS the method stimulates the vagus nerve as indicated in using the magnetic stimulation devices that are disclosed herein. The position and angular orientation of the device are adjusted about that location until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator coils. The applied current is increased gradually first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The power is then increased but is set to a level that is less than one at which the patient first indicates any discomfort. Straps harnesses or frames are used to maintain the stimulator in position not shown in or . The stimulator signal may have a frequency and other parameters that are selected to influence the therapeutic result. For example a pulse width may be from about 0.01 ms to 500.0 ms typically 200 ms. The pulses may be delivered at a frequency of 0.5 to 500 Hz typically 20 Hz. The stimulation may be performed for 1 to 200 minutes typically for 30 minutes. Typically the treatment is performed repeatedly e.g. once a month for six months or throughout a period of remission. However parameters of the stimulation may be varied in order to obtain a beneficial response as indicated for example by measuring levels and or activities of TGF or other anti inflammatory cytokines pro inflammatory cytokines and or neurotrophic factors such as BDNF in the patient s peripheral circulation and or in the patient s cerebrospinal fluid before during and subsequent to each treatment. A beneficial response may also be determined through use of standard diagnostic tools for MS including neuroimaging analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. The treatment is primarily intended to prevent MS relapses during remission but it may also be administered to patients while a MS relapse is in progress so as to hasten entry into remission.

Postoperative cognitive dysfunction POCD is a loss in cognitive function after surgery. The loss may include memory the ability to learn the ability to concentrate and or the ability to reason and comprehend. The cognitive decline may be subtle such that psychological testing is needed to detect it or it may be profound and obvious.

POCD does not refer to delirium that may occur immediately after surgery but instead refers to cognitive loss that may persist weeks months or permanently after the surgery. However postoperative cognitive dysfunction and postoperative delirium POD are not mutually exclusive. They may in fact have risk factors mechanisms and treatment options in common. Accordingly background information pertaining to POD is presented below after first discussing POCD and disclosing methods for treating POCD.

A limited number of studies have been conducted to evaluate whether certain demographic populations are at higher risk to suffer from POCD whether the risk is contingent on the type of surgery whether the risk depends on the anesthesia that was used how the medical condition of the patient prior to the surgery influences the risk whether drug sensitivity is involved and whether these variables influence the duration of the POCD its preventability or its treatability. Elderly patients are at greatest risk for developing POCD. A low level of education predisposes a risk of POCD. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at greatest risk especially those with progressive atherosclerosis. However major surgery in general poses a greater risk of developing POCD than minor surgery. The incidence of prolonged POCD is apparently similar regardless of the anesthetic technique used suggesting that nonanesthetic factors are likely to be important. However use of regional anesthesia decreases the incidence of POCD early after surgery. Lars S. RASMUSSEN. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction Incidence and prevention.

The pathophysiology of POCD has been investigated in view of the above clinical findings and in the context of cellular responses to surgery in general Niamh Ni CHOILEAIN and H. Paul Redmond. Cell response to surgery. Arch Surg 2006 141 1132 40 XIE G L Zhang W Chang Y Z Chu Q J.

Inflammation a bridge between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and Alzheimer s disease. Med Hypotheses. 2010 April 74 4 722 4 .

Although the cause of POCD appears to be multifactorial the response of the body to the surgery itself appears to be a primary contributing factor. This is because decreased surgical trauma is associated with a decreased risk of POCD and the stress of surgery triggers an inflammatory response with release of cytokines that may be responsible for changes in brain function and recovery. Furthermore a correlation has been observed in patients interleukin 6 cortisol and late functional recovery. Animal experiments also indicate that there is a relation between cytokine mediated inflammation and POCD Y WAN J Xu D Ma Y Zeng M Cibelli M Maze. Postoperative impairment of cognitive function in rats a possible role for cytokine mediated inflammation in the hippocampus. Anesthesiology 2007 106 436 43 .

There is currently no generally agreed upon treatment for POCD. Primary prevention by providing good oxygenation and cerebral perfusion during surgery and adequate analgesia and emotional support after surgery have been suggested including the use of occupational therapy and biofeedback. Medical conditions that could also contribute to POCD should also be treated such as hypothyroidism. Otherwise there are few treatment options. XIONG et al suggested that transcutaneous stimulation of the vagus nerve may attenuate the inflammatory response that appears to be associated with POCD. Their suggestion was that the stimulation be transcutaneous because implantation of a vagal nerve stimulator by surgery may exacerbate the very surgery induced problem that the stimulation is intended to treat. XIONG J Xue F S Liu J H Xu Y C Liao X Zhang Y M Wang W L Li S. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation may attenuate postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. Medical Hypotheses 73 2009 938 941 .

However the site of transcutaneous vagal stimulation that XIONG et al suggest is the external auditory canal. This may not be as effective as stimulating at the site where vagus nerve stimulators are ordinarily implanted namely in the neck. Furthermore XIONG et al do not suggest stimulation parameters that should be used. Accordingly methods are disclosed here to better treat POCD patients. The methods counteract inflammation by any of the mechanisms shown in .

In the preferred embodiment the method stimulates the vagus nerve in the neck as indicated in using the magnetic stimulation devices that are disclosed herein. The position is adjusted about that location and the angular orientation of the device is also rotated about that location until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator coils. The applied current is increased gradually first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The power is then increased but is set to a level that is less than one at which the patient first indicates any discomfort. Straps harnesses or frames are used to maintain the stimulator in position not shown in or . The stimulator signal may have a frequency and other parameters that are selected to influence the therapeutic result. For example a pulse width may be from about 0.01 ms to 500.0 ms typically 200 ms. The pulses may be delivered at a frequency of 0.5 to 500 Hz. typically 20 Hz. The stimulation may be performed for 1 to 200 minutes typically for 30 minutes. Typically the treatment is performed repeatedly e.g. once a week for six months. However parameters of the stimulation may be varied in order to obtain a beneficial response as indicated for example by the measurement of levels and or activities of TGF beta neurotrophic factors retinoic acid and or TNF alpha in the patient s peripheral circulation and or in the patient s cerebrospinal fluid during and subsequent to each treatment or by psychological evaluation of the extent of the patient s cognitive dysfunction.

If a patient experiences postoperative delirium before experiencing POCD the disclosed method of treatment is initially somewhat different as now described. According to the American Psychiatric Association diagnostic manual DSM IV TR delirium is a potentially reversible state of acute brain failure with disturbance of consciousness accompanied by cognitive deficits that cannot be accounted for by past or evolving dementia and is associated with evidence of physiological disturbance owing to a medical condition. It is characterized by the inability to focus attention disorientation that is not attributable to dementia sleep disturbance and sometimes disruptive behavior. However in the elderly the earliest signs of delirium may be withdrawal rather than agitation.

Postoperative delirium POD is delirium that develops acutely after surgery usually within hours to days and its severity often fluctuates during the course of the day. The physiological disturbance with which the delirium is associated is the surgery itself. The time course of POD is typically a shock phase of several hours after surgery in which the patient is hypometabolic followed by a hypermetabolic inflammatory phase that ordinarily peaks two days after surgery followed by a return to normal within a week. If the problem does not resolve itself completely within this time frame the patient may be considered to suffer from postoperative cognitive dysfunction POCD rather than POD.

POD occurs in 10 to 50 of postoperative patients and in 80 of elderly patients who require intensive care. Patients undergoing cardiovascular major abdominal and orthopedic surgery are most prone to develop POD. Twenty five percent of elderly patients who exhibit POD die within six months.

Factors that may predispose to the development of POD include exposure to toxins including CNS active drugs and alcohol abuse infection inflammation resulting for example from autoimmune disease trauma including postoperative trauma decreased cardiac output and or oxygen saturation vascular disease metabolic derangement vitamin deficiency central nervous system states such as epilepsy hydrocephalus and central nervous system lesions. Prevention or treatment of POD will initially involve the identification management and or elimination of such predisposing factors Yu Ling CHANG Yun Fang Tsai Pyng Jing Lin Min Chi Chen and Chia Yih Liu. Prevalence and risk factors for postoperative delirium in a cardiovascular intensive care unit. American Journal of Critical Care. 2008 17 567 575 RUDRA A Chatterjee 5 Kirtania J Sengupta S Moitra G Sirohia S Wankhade R Banerjee S. Postoperative delirium. Indian J Crit Care Med 2006 10 235 40 .

Behavior suggestive of delirium includes the inability to focus attention incoherent speech hallucination withdrawal or hypervigilance. In contrast to dementia such behavior with POD may fluctuate significantly over the course of even a few hours. The Delirium Symptom Interview the Confusion Assessment Method the Delirium Scale the Delirium Rating Scale and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale are formal psychological measurements that are useful for forming an initial diagnosis of patients who are not agitated.

The antidopaminergic drug haloperidol is often administered intravenously to counter the neuronal dysfunction associated with delirium especially when agitation is present. This is because psychotic fear in delirium may originate in the amygdala which abnormally excites dopamine subpopulations that project to limbic areas and to cognitive regions of the cortex and striatum. Thus fear in delirium requires the use of dopamine blocking neuroleptics rather than benzodiazepines. However careful monitoring of the cardiovascular system is necessary because of the potential for ventricular arrhythmia following use of haloperidol Gregory L. FRICCHIONE Shamim H. Nejad Justin A. Esses Thomas J. Cummings Jr. John Querques Ned H. Cassem and George B. Murray. Postoperative Delirium. Am J Psychiatry 165 7 Jul. 2008 803 812 .

POD is thought to arise initially because leukocytes adhere to surgically damaged endothelial cells and become activated. Their degranulation releases free oxygen radicals and enzymes which in turn leads to endothelial cell membrane destruction loosening of intercellular tights extravascular fluid shift and formation of perivascular edema. The immune response in the brain is amplified in patients whose predisposing factors cause the blood brain barrier to have compromised integrity James L. RUDOLPH Basel Ramlawi George A. Kuchel Janet E. McElhaney Dongxu Xie Frank W. Sellke Kamal Khabbaz Sue E. Levkoff and Edward R. Marcantonio. Chemokines are Associated with Delirium after Cardiac Surgery. J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2008 February 63 2 184 189 . The edema in turn produces longer diffusion distance for oxygen to reach nerve cells. Furthermore the blood flow in individual capillaries may become disrupted. Synthesis and release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine ACH is particularly sensitive to the resulting hypoxia especially in the elderly.

Such oxidative stress may produce localized neuronal dysfunction in the hippocampus and amygdala which subsequently progresses to dysfunction in the brainstem gray matter and cerebellum. The neuronal dysfunction is associated with neurotransmitter disequilibrium corresponding to decreased acetylcholine and GABA as well as increased dopamine and glutamate. That neurotransmitter dysfunction ultimately produces the symptoms of delirium. Thus the decreased ACH leads to a relative excess of dopaminergic transmission wherein the amygdala projects to dopamine subpopulations in limbic and cognitive areas of the brain that produce fear in delirious patients.

Accordingly applicants disclose herein a method for preventing or minimizing excessive development of the perioperative inflammation that leads to POD. The method is like that used to treat POCD in that involves stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck to increase reserve levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in such a way as to promote a normal balance of neurotransmitter levels. However the method differs from that used to treat POCD in that the parameters of the stimulation are selected to specifically promote normal neurotransmitter levels in the amygdala and in the limbic and cognitive areas of the brain to which the amygdala projects. Vagal afferents traverse the brainstem in the solitary tract with terminating synapses particularly located in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius NTS . The NTS projects to a wide variety of structures including the parabrachial nucleus which in turn projects to the hypothalamus the thalamus the amygdala the anterior insular and infralimbic cortex lateral prefrontal cortex and other cortical regions. Through its projection to the amygdala the NTS gains access to amygdala hippocampus entorhinal cortex pathways of the limbic system. Thus the disclosed treatment of POD by vagal nerve stimulation uses parameters intensity pulse width frequency duty cycle etc. that preferentially activate the limbic system via the amygdala Jeong Ho CHAE Ziad Nahas Mikhail Lomarev Stewart Denslow Jeffrey P.

In the preferred embodiment the method stimulates the vagus nerve in the neck as indicated in using the magnetic stimulation devices that are disclosed herein. Any of the anti inflammatory mechanisms shown in may be induced by the stimulation.

The position of the device is adjusted and the angular orientation of the device is also rotated about an initial location until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator coils. The applied current is increased gradually first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation.
