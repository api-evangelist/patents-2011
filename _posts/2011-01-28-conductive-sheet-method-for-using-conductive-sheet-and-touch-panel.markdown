The present invention is a 35 U.S.C. 371 National Stage Entry of PCT JP2011 051692 filed Jan. 28 2011 which claims priority from Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2010 017293 filed on Jan. 28 2010 2010 105865 filed on Apr. 30 2010 2010 153232 filed on Jul. 5 2010 and 2010 281465 filed on Dec. 17 2010 the contents of all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to a conductive sheet a method for using a conductive sheet and a touch panel and for example to a conductive sheet suitable for use in a projected capacitive touch panel a method for using a conductive sheet and a touch panel.

Touch panels have attracted much attention in recent years. For example a touch panel which uses ITO indium tin oxide as an electrode material to form a less visible electrode matrix has been disclosed see Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 2008 129708 and 05 224818 etc. 

Though the touch panels have currently been used mainly in small devices such as PDAs personal digital assistants and mobile phones they are expected to be used in larger devices such as personal computer displays.

The above electrode is composed of the ITO indium tin oxide and therefore has a high resistance. Thus when the conventional touch panel is used in the larger device in the above future trend the large sized touch panel disadvantageously has a low current transfer rate between the electrodes and thereby exhibits a low response speed a long time between finger contact and touch position detection .

A large number of lattices composed of thin wires of a metal thin metal wires can be arranged to form an electrode with a lowered surface resistance. A touch panel using the electrode of the thin metal wires is known from U.S. Pat. No. 5 113 041 International Patent Publication No. 95 027334 US Patent Application Publication No. 2004 0239650 U.S. Pat. No. 7 202 859 International Patent Publication No. 97 018508 and Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2003 099185 etc.

However in the case of using the thin metal wires for the electrode the thin metal wires are composed of an opaque material whereby the electrode has problems of transparency and visibility.

In view of the problems an object of the present invention is to provide a conductive sheet which can have a conductive pattern with a lowered resistance can exhibit an improved visibility and can be suitably used in a projected capacitive touch panel or the like and a method for using the conductive sheet.

As described above in the conductive sheet and the conductive sheet using method of the present invention the conductive pattern formed on the substrate can exhibit a lowered resistance and an improved visibility and the conductive sheet can be suitably used in a projected capacitive touch panel or the like.

Furthermore in the touch panel of the present invention the conductive pattern formed on the substrate can exhibit a lowered resistance and an improved visibility and the touch panel can be used as a large sized projected capacitive touch panel or the like.

Several embodiments of the conductive sheet the conductive sheet using method and the touch panel of the present invention will be described below with reference to . It should be noted that in this description a numeric range of A to B includes both the numeric values A and B as the lower limit and upper limit values.

A conductive sheet according to a first embodiment of the present invention hereinafter referred to as the first conductive sheet A will be described below with reference to .

As shown in the first conductive sheet A has a first conductive part A formed on one main surface of a first transparent substrate A see . The first conductive part A contains two or more conductive first large lattices A composed of thin metal wires and each of the first large lattices A contains a combination of two or more small lattices . A first dummy pattern A a first unconnected pattern composed of thin metal wires separated from the first large lattices A is formed around each side of the first large lattices A. A first connection A composed of thin metal wires is formed between each adjacent two of the first large lattices A to electrically connect the first large lattices A. The first connection A contains one or more medium lattices to and the pitch of the medium lattices is n times larger than that of the small lattices in which n is a real number larger than 1 . The small lattices have a smallest square shape in this embodiment. For example the thin metal wires contain gold Au silver Ag or copper Cu .

The side length of the first large lattice A is preferably 3 to 10 mm more preferably 4 to 6 mm. If the side length is less than the lower limit in the case of using the first conductive sheet A in a touch panel or the like the first large lattice A exhibits a lowered electrostatic capacitance in a detection process and the touch panel is likely to cause a detection trouble. On the other hand if the side length is more than the upper limit the position detection accuracy may be deteriorated. The side length of each small lattice in the first large lattice A is preferably 50 to 500 m more preferably 150 to 300 m for the same reasons. If the side length of the small lattice is within this range the first conductive sheet A can have excellent transparency and thereby can be suitably used at the front of a display device with excellent visibility without creating any feeling of strangeness.

The lower limit of the line width of the thin metal wire is preferably 1 m or more 3 m or more 4 m or more or 5 m or more and the upper limit thereof is preferably 15 m or less 10 m or less 9 m or less or 8 m or less. If the line width is less than the lower limit the thin metal wire has an insufficient conductivity whereby a touch panel using the thin metal wire has insufficient detection sensitivity. On the other hand if the line width is more than the upper limit a moire may be significantly generated due to the conductive metal portion and a touch panel using the thin metal wire may have a poor visibility. If the line width is within the above range the moire of the conductive metal portion is improved and the visibility is remarkably improved.

Two or more of the first large lattices A are arranged in an x direction a first direction with the first connection A disposed therebetween to form one first conductive pattern A composed of the thin metal wires . Two or more of the first conductive patterns A are arranged in a y direction a second direction perpendicular to the x direction and electrically isolated first insulations A are disposed between the adjacent first conductive patterns A.

For example the x direction corresponds to the horizontal or vertical direction of a projected capacitive touch panel or a display panel equipped therewith to be hereinafter described see .

As shown in four sides of the first large lattice A i.e. a first side and a second side on one corner unconnected to the adjacent first large lattice A and a third side and a fourth side on the other corner unconnected to the adjacent first large lattice A each have a straight line shape. In other words the intersection of the straight lines of the first side and the second side corresponds to the one corner of the first large lattice A and the intersection of the straight lines of the third side and the fourth side corresponds to the other corner of the first large lattice A.

In the first connection A the four medium lattices the first medium lattice to the fourth medium lattice are arranged in a zigzag manner and each of the medium lattices has a size equal to the total of four small lattices . The first medium lattice is disposed at the intersection of the second side and the fourth side and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice . The second medium lattice is disposed on one side of the first medium lattice and forms such a square space that four small lattices are arranged in a matrix and the central cross is removed. The third medium lattice is adjacent to one vertex of the first medium lattice and one side of the second medium lattice and has the same shape as the second medium lattice . The fourth medium lattice is disposed at the intersection of the third side and the first side is adjacent to one vertex of the second medium lattice and one side of the third medium lattice and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice as in the first medium lattice . When the small lattices have an arrangement pitch of P the medium lattices have an arrangement pitch of 2P.

The above described first dummy pattern A is formed around each of the four sides the first side to the fourth side of the first large lattice A. The first dummy pattern A is such that a part of the small lattice is removed to provide a remaining part and two or more remaining parts are arranged along the corresponding side straight line . In the example of the remaining part is provided by removing one side from the small lattice and thus has a shape with two corners and one opening referred to simply as an approximately U shape and ten remaining parts are arranged such that the openings are opened in the direction away from the corresponding side of the first large lattice A. The arrangement pitch of the remaining parts is twice as large as the arrangement pitch P of the small lattices in the first large lattice A. For example the shortest distance between the straight line shape of the first side and the approximately U shape of the first dummy pattern A is approximately equal to the inside side length of the small lattice . This is true also for the second side to the fourth side

In the first insulation A a first insulation pattern A unconnected to the first large lattices A is formed. The first insulation pattern A has a first assembly pattern portion containing two or more small lattices arranged and three spaces to containing no small lattices .

Specifically the first assembly pattern portion contains a combination of four straight lines two long straight lines and two short straight lines composed of a plurality of the small lattices . Each of the straight lines is formed by arranging a plurality of the small lattices to connect the vertices of the small lattices . With respect to the adjacent two first large lattices A and two second large lattices B with the first insulation A interposed therebetween the three spaces include the first space containing no small lattices surrounded by the first assembly pattern portion the second space containing no small lattices formed around the other corner of one first large lattice A and the third space containing no small lattices formed around the one corner of the other first large lattice A.

For example among the four straight lines each of the two long straight lines is formed by arranging seven small lattices to connect the vertices thereof. The small lattice in one end of one long straight line is positioned adjacent to the first dummy pattern A along the third side of the one first large lattice A at the same pitch around the other corner of the one first large lattice A and the small lattice in the other end of the one long straight line is positioned adjacent to the first dummy pattern A along the first side of the other first large lattice A at the same pitch around the one corner of the other first large lattice A. Similarly the small lattice in one end of the other long straight line is positioned adjacent to the first dummy pattern A along the fourth side of the one first large lattice A at the same pitch around the other corner of the one first large lattice A and the small lattice in the other end of the other long straight line is positioned adjacent to the first dummy pattern A along the second side of the other first large lattice A at the same pitch around the one corner of the other first large lattice A.

Among the two short straight lines one short straight line contains two small lattices connecting the 2nd small lattice from one end in the one long straight line and the 2nd small lattice from one end in the other long straight line. Similarly the other short straight line contains two small lattices connecting the 2nd small lattice from the other end in the one long straight line and the 2nd small lattice from the other end in the other long straight line.

When the small lattices have an arrangement pitch of P the first insulation A has a width of m P in which m is an integer of 1 or more . The width of the first insulation A is defined as the shortest distance between the adjacent first conductive patterns A i.e. the distance between the other corner of the one first large lattice A and the one corner of the other first large lattice A . Thus the first insulation pattern A has a maximum length of m P or less in the width direction of the first insulation A. The maximum length is the distance between a part in the one short straight line facing the other corner of the one first large lattice A and a part in the other short straight line facing the one corner of the other first large lattice A.

As described above in the first conductive sheet A the first conductive pattern A composed of the thin metal wires is formed by connecting two or more first large lattices A in series in the first direction the first large lattice A is formed by combining two or more small lattices the first dummy pattern A composed of the thin metal wires separated from the first large lattice A is formed around each side of the first large lattice A the thin metal wire has a line width of 1 to 15 m and the small lattice has a side length of 50 to 500 m. As a result the first conductive sheet A can exhibit a significantly lowered electrical resistance as compared with conventional structures using one ITO film for one electrode. Thus in a case where the first conductive sheet A is used in the projected capacitive touch panel or the like the response speed and the size of the touch panel can be easily increased.

The touch panel containing the above first conductive sheet A will be described below with reference to .

The touch panel has a sensor body and a control circuit such as an input circuit not shown . As shown in and A the sensor body contains a touch panel conductive sheet according to the first embodiment hereinafter referred to as the first laminated conductive sheet A and thereon a protective layer not shown in . The first laminated conductive sheet A is obtained by stacking the above first conductive sheet A and a second conductive sheet B to be hereinafter described. The first laminated conductive sheet A and the protective layer are disposed on the display panel of a display device such as a liquid crystal display. As viewed from above the sensor body has a sensing region corresponding to a display screen of the display panel and a terminal wiring region a so called frame corresponding to the periphery of the display panel .

In the first conductive sheet A of the touch panel in one end of each first conductive pattern A the first connection A is not formed on the open end of the first large lattice A. In the other end of the first conductive pattern A the end of the first large lattice A is electrically connected to a first terminal wiring pattern composed of a thin metal wire by a first wire connection see . As shown in a plurality of the first conductive patterns A are arranged in the sensing region and a plurality of the first terminal wiring patterns extend from the first wire connections in the terminal wiring region .

In the example of the first conductive sheet A and the sensing region each have a rectangular shape as viewed from above. In the terminal wiring region a plurality of first terminals are arranged in the length direction in the longitudinal center of the periphery on one long side of the first conductive sheet A. The first wire connections are arranged in a straight line in the y direction along one long side of the sensing region a long side closest to the one long side of the first conductive sheet A . The first terminal wiring pattern extends from each first wire connection to the center of the one long side of the first conductive sheet A and is electrically connected to the corresponding first terminal . Thus the first terminal wiring patterns connected to each pair of corresponding first wire connections formed on the right and left of the one long side of the sensing region have approximately the same lengths. Of course the first terminals may be formed in a corner of the first conductive sheet A or the vicinity thereof. However in this case the length difference between the longest and shortest first terminal wiring patterns is increased whereby the longest first terminal wiring pattern and the first terminal wiring patterns in the vicinity thereof are disadvantageously poor in the rate of transferring a signal to the corresponding first conductive pattern A. Thus in this embodiment the first terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the one long side of the first conductive sheet A whereby the local signal transfer rate deterioration is prevented to increase the response speed.

As shown in and A the second conductive sheet B has a second conductive part B formed on one main surface of a second transparent substrate B see . The second conductive part B contains two or more conductive second large lattices B composed of thin metal wires and each of the second large lattices B contains a combination of two or more small lattices . A second dummy pattern B a second unconnected pattern separated from the second large lattices B is formed around each side of the second large lattices B. A second connection B composed of thin metal wires is formed between each adjacent two of the second large lattices B to electrically connect the second large lattices B. The second connection B contains one or more medium lattices to and the pitch of the medium lattices is n times larger than that of the small lattices in which n is a real number larger than 1 . The side length of the second large lattice B is preferably 3 to 10 mm more preferably 4 to 6 mm as well as the first large lattice A.

Two or more of the second large lattices B are arranged in the y direction the second direction with the second connections B disposed therebetween to form one second conductive pattern B and two or more of the second conductive patterns B are arranged in the x direction the first direction . Electrically isolated second insulations B are disposed between the adjacent second conductive patterns B.

As shown in for example in one end of each alternate odd numbered for example second conductive pattern B and in the other end of each even numbered second conductive pattern B the second connection B is not formed on the open end of the second large lattice B. In the other end of each odd numbered second conductive pattern B and in one end of each even numbered second conductive pattern B the end of the second large lattice B is electrically connected to a second terminal wiring pattern composed of a thin metal wire by a second wire connection

A large number of the second conductive patterns B are arranged in the sensing region and a plurality of the second terminal wiring patterns extending from the second wire connections are arranged in the terminal wiring region .

As shown in in the terminal wiring region a plurality of second terminals are arranged in the length direction in the longitudinal center of the periphery on one long side of the second conductive sheet B. For example a plurality of the odd numbered second wire connections are arranged in a straight line in the x direction along one short side of the sensing region a short side closest to one short side of the second conductive sheet B and a plurality of the even numbered second wire connections are arranged in a straight line in the x direction along the other short side of the sensing region a short side closest to the other short side of the second conductive sheet B .

For example among a plurality of the second conductive patterns B each odd numbered second conductive pattern B is connected to the corresponding odd numbered second wire connection and each even numbered second conductive pattern B is connected to the corresponding even numbered second wire connection . The second terminal wiring patterns extend from the odd numbered and even numbered second wire connections to the approximate center of one long side of the second conductive sheet B and are each electrically connected to the corresponding second terminal . Thus for example the 1st and 2nd second terminal wiring patterns have approximately the same lengths and similarly the 2n 1 th and 2n th second terminal wiring patterns have approximately the same lengths n 1 2 3 . . . .

Of course the second terminals may be formed in a corner of the second conductive sheet B or the vicinity thereof. However in this case as described above the longest second terminal wiring pattern and the second terminal wiring patterns in the vicinity thereof are disadvantageously poor in the rate of transferring a signal to the corresponding second conductive pattern B. Thus in this embodiment the second terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the one long side of the second conductive sheet B whereby the local signal transfer rate deterioration is prevented so that the response speed is increased.

The first terminal wiring patterns may be arranged in the same manner as in the above second terminal wiring patterns and the second terminal wiring patterns may be arranged in the same manner as in the above first terminal wiring patterns

In a case where the first laminated conductive sheet A is used in a touch panel the protective layer is formed on the first conductive sheet A and the first terminal wiring patterns extending from a large number of the first conductive patterns A in the first conductive sheet A and the second terminal wiring patterns extending from a large number of the second conductive patterns B in the second conductive sheet B are connected to a scan control circuit or the like.

A self or mutual capacitance technology can be preferably used for detecting a touch position. In the self capacitance technology a voltage signal for the touch position detection is sequentially supplied to the first conductive patterns A and further a voltage signal for the touch position detection is sequentially supplied to the second conductive patterns B. When a finger is brought into contact with or close to the upper surface of the protective layer the capacitance between the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B corresponding to the touch position the position in the upper surface of the protective layer which the finger is brought into contact with or close to and the GND ground is increased whereby signals from this first conductive pattern A and this second conductive pattern B have a waveform different from those of signals from the other conductive patterns. Thus the touch position is calculated by the control circuit based on the signals transmitted from the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B. On the other hand in the mutual capacitance technology for example a voltage signal for the touch position detection is sequentially supplied to the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are sequentially subjected to a sensing process transmitted signal detection . When a finger is brought into contact with or close to the upper surface of the protective layer the parallel stray capacitance of the finger is added to the parasitic capacitance between the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B corresponding to the touch position whereby a signal from this second conductive pattern B has a waveform different from those of signals from the other second conductive patterns B. Thus the touch position is calculated by the control circuit based on the order of the first conductive patterns A supplied with the voltage signal and the signal transmitted from the second conductive pattern B. Even when two fingers are brought into contact with or close to the upper surface of the protective layer simultaneously the touch positions can be detected by using the self or mutual capacitance technology. Conventional related detection circuits used in projected capacitive technologies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 582 955 4 686 332 4 733 222 5 374 787 5 543 588 and 7 030 860 US Patent Publication No. 2004 0155871 etc.

As shown in the second large lattice B has an approximately octagonal shape unlike the first large lattice A. The second large lattice B has four short sides a first short side to a fourth short side and four long sides a first long side to a fourth long side . With respect to the second large lattices B arranged adjacent in the y direction the second connection B is formed between the first short side of one second large lattice B and the second short side of another second large lattice B. With respect to the second large lattices B arranged adjacent in the x direction the second insulation B is formed between the third short side of one second large lattice B and the fourth short side of another second large lattice B.

The four long sides of the second large lattice B each have a straight line shape i.e. the first long side and the second long side adjacent to the third short side facing one second insulation B and the third long side and the fourth long side are adjacent to the fourth short side facing another second insulation B.

In the second connection B the four medium lattices the fifth medium lattice to the eighth medium lattice are arranged in a zigzag manner and each of the medium lattices has a size equal to the total of four small lattices . The fifth medium lattice is disposed on the first short side and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice . The sixth medium lattice is disposed on one side of the fifth medium lattice and forms such a square space that four small lattices are arranged in a matrix and the central cross is removed. The seventh medium lattice is adjacent to one vertex of the fifth medium lattice and one side of the sixth medium lattice and has the same shape as the sixth medium lattice . The eighth medium lattice is disposed on the second short side is adjacent to one vertex of the sixth medium lattice and one side of the seventh medium lattice and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice as in the fifth medium lattice . When the small lattices have an arrangement pitch of P the medium lattices have an arrangement pitch of 2P.

The above described second dummy pattern B is formed around each of the four long sides the first long side to the fourth long side of the second large lattice B. The second dummy pattern B is provided such that a part of the small lattice is removed to provide a remaining part and two or more remaining parts are arranged along the corresponding side straight line shape . In the example of the remaining part is provided by removing one side from the small lattice and thus has an approximately U shape and ten remaining parts are arranged such that the openings are opened in the direction away from the corresponding long side of the second large lattice B. The arrangement pitch of the remaining parts is twice as large as the arrangement pitch P of the small lattices in the second large lattices B. For example the shortest distance between the straight line shape of the first long side and the approximately U shape of the second dummy pattern B is approximately equal to the inside side length of the small lattice . This is true also for the second long side to the fourth long side

In the second insulation B a second insulation pattern B unconnected to the second large lattices B is formed. The second insulation pattern B has a second assembly pattern portion containing two or more small lattices arranged a first bend pattern portion and a second bend pattern portion each containing two approximately U shapes and one space a fourth space containing no small lattices .

Specifically the second assembly pattern portion is formed by arranging a plurality of for example six small lattices in a matrix to connect the vertices of the small lattices . The number of the small lattices is determined such that the small lattices can be placed in the first space of the first insulation pattern A in the first conductive pattern A shown in .

The first bend pattern portion has the two approximately U shapes formed on one end of the second insulation pattern B between the intersection of the fourth short side and the third long side in one second large lattice B and the intersection of the third short side and the first long side in another second large lattice B . The ends of the two approximately U shapes are connected and an angle formed by the sides at the ends is approximately 90 .

Similarly the second bend pattern portion has the two approximately U shapes formed on the other end of the second insulation pattern B between the intersection of the fourth short side and the fourth long side in the one second large lattice B and the intersection of the third short side and the second long side in the other second large lattice B . The ends of the two approximately U shapes are connected and an angle formed by the sides at the ends is approximately 90 .

The fourth space containing no small lattices has a shape in which the four straight lines of the first assembly pattern portion in the first insulation pattern A shown in can be placed.

When the small lattices have an arrangement pitch P the second insulation B has a width of n P in which n is an integer of 1 or more . The width of the second insulation B is defined as the shortest distance between the adjacent second conductive patterns B i.e. the distance between the fourth short side of the one second large lattice B and the third short side of the other second large lattice B . Thus the second insulation pattern B has a maximum length of n P or less preferably less than n P in the width direction of the second insulation B. The maximum length is the distance between a part facing the fourth short side of the one second large lattice B and a part facing the third short side of the other second large lattice B in the second assembly pattern portion

For example as shown in in a case where the first conductive sheet A is stacked on the second conductive sheet B to form the first laminated conductive sheet A the first connections A of the first conductive patterns A and the second connections B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A see interposed therebetween and the first insulations A of the first conductive patterns A and the second insulations B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A interposed therebetween. Though the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B have the same line width they are exaggeratingly shown by thick lines and thin lines respectively to clearly represent the positions thereof in .

When the stack of the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B is viewed from above spaces between the first large lattices A in the first conductive sheet A are filled with the second large lattices B in the second conductive sheet B. Thus the sensing region is covered with the large lattices. In this case the first dummy patterns A and the second dummy patterns B overlap with each other to form combined patterns between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B. The combined pattern has a width equal to or larger than the side length of the small lattice . The width of the combined pattern is defined as the shortest distance projected on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A for example between the first side of the first large lattice A and the second long side facing the first side of the second large lattice B. In the example of the width of the combined pattern is twice as large as the side length of the small lattice . This is true also for the relations between the second side to the fourth side of the first large lattice A and the second long side to the fourth long side of the second large lattice B.

Thus as viewed from above the openings of the approximately U shapes in the first dummy patterns A along the first large lattices A are closed by the straight long sides of the second large lattices B and the bottoms of the approximately U shapes in the first dummy patterns A are connected by the bottoms of the approximately U shapes in the second dummy patterns B along the second large lattices B. Similarly the openings of the approximately U shapes in the second dummy patterns B along the second large lattices B are closed by the straight long sides of the first large lattices A and the bottoms of the approximately U shapes in the second dummy patterns B are connected by the bottoms of the approximately U shapes in the first dummy patterns A along the first large lattices A. As a result a plurality of the small lattices are arranged as viewed from above and the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B can hardly be found.

For example in the case of not forming the first dummy patterns A and the second dummy patterns B blank areas corresponding to the combined pattern width are formed whereby the edges of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are highly visible and the visibility is deteriorated. This problem may be solved by overlapping each side of the first large lattices A with the corresponding long side of the second large lattices B to prevent the formation of the blank area. However when the stack position accuracy is slightly deteriorated the overlaps of the straight lines have increased widths the overlaps are thickened whereby the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are highly visible and thus the visibility is again deteriorated.

In contrast in this embodiment the first dummy patterns A and the second dummy patterns B are stacked in the above manner whereby the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are made less visible to improve the visibility.

In the case of overlapping each side of the first large lattices A with the corresponding long side of the second large lattices B to prevent the formation of the blank area as described above the first to fourth long sides to of the second large lattices B are positioned right under the first to fourth sides to of the first large lattice A. In this case all the first to fourth sides to and the first to fourth long sides to function as conductive portions so that a parasitic capacitance is formed between the side of the first large lattice A and the long side of the second large lattice B and the parasitic capacitance acts as a noise on charge information causing significant deterioration in the S N ratio. Furthermore since the parasitic capacitance is formed between each pair of the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B a large number of the parasitic capacitances are connected in parallel in the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B resulting in increase of the CR time constant. When the CR time constant is increased there is a possibility that the waveform rise of the voltage signal supplied to the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B is retarded and an electric field for the position detection is hardly generated under a predetermined scan time. In addition there is also a possibility that the waveform rise or fall of the signal transmitted from each of the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B is retarded and the waveform change of the transmitted signal cannot be detected under a predetermined scan time. This leads to detection accuracy deterioration and response speed deterioration. Thus in this case the detection accuracy and response speed can be improved only by reducing the number of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B lowering the resolution or by reducing the size of the display screen and the laminated conductive sheet cannot be used in a large screen such as a B5 sized A4 sized or larger screen.

In contrast in this embodiment as shown in the projected distance Lf between the side of the first large lattice A and the long side of the second large lattice B is approximately twice as large as the side length of the small lattice . Therefore only a small parasitic capacitance is formed between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B. As a result the CR time constant can be reduced to improve the detection accuracy and the response speed. In the combined pattern of the first dummy pattern A and the second dummy pattern B each corner of the first dummy pattern A overlaps with the corresponding corner of the second dummy pattern B. However this overlap does not result in increase of the parasitic capacitance between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B because the first dummy pattern A is unconnected with and electrically isolated from the first large lattice A and the second dummy pattern B is unconnected with and electrically isolated from the second large lattice B.

It is preferred that the optimum value of the projected distance Lf is appropriately determined depending not on the sizes of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B but on the sizes the line widths and the side lengths of the small lattices in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B. When the small lattices have an excessively large size as compared with the sizes of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B the resultant conductive sheet may have a high light transmittance but the dynamic range of the transmitted signal may be reduced lowering the detection sensitivity. On the other hand when the small lattices have an excessively small size the resultant conductive sheet may have high detection sensitivity but the light transmittance may be deteriorated under the restriction of line width reduction.

When the small lattices have a line width of 1 to 9 m the optimum value of the projected distance Lf the optimum distance is preferably 100 to 400 m more preferably 200 to 300 m. In a case where the small lattices have a smaller line width the optimum distance can be further reduced. However in this case the electrical resistance is increased so that the CR time constant may be increased even under a small parasitic capacitance disadvantageously deteriorating the detection sensitivity and the response speed. Thus the line width of the small lattice is preferably within the above range.

For example the sizes of the first large lattice A the second large lattice B and the small lattice are determined based on the size of the display panel or the size and touch position detection resolution drive pulse period or the like of the sensing region and the optimum distance between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B is obtained based on the line width of the small lattice .

When the overlap of the first connection A and the second connection B is viewed from above the connection point of the fifth medium lattice and the seventh medium lattice in the second connection B is positioned approximately at the center of the second medium lattice around the first large lattice A the connection point of the sixth medium lattice and the eighth medium lattice in the second connection B is positioned approximately at the center of the third medium lattice around the first large lattice A and the first medium lattice to the eighth medium lattice form a plurality of the small lattices in combination. Therefore the small lattices are formed by the combination of the first connections A and the second connections B in the overlaps thereof. Thus formed small lattices cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B so that the visibility is improved.

When the overlap of the first insulation pattern A of the first insulation A and the second insulation pattern B of the second insulation B is viewed from above the first assembly pattern portion of the first insulation pattern A is arranged facing the fourth space of the second insulation pattern B and the first space of the first insulation pattern A is arranged facing the second assembly pattern portion of the second insulation pattern B. Furthermore the second space of the first insulation pattern A is arranged facing the first bend pattern portion of the second insulation pattern B and the third space of the first insulation pattern A is arranged facing the second bend pattern portion of the second insulation pattern B. In this case as viewed from above the opening of the first bend pattern portion is closed by the straight line shapes of the third side and the fourth side around the other corner of the first large lattice A and the opening of the second bend pattern portion is closed by the straight line shapes of the first side and the second side around the one corner of the first large lattice A. Therefore the first insulation patterns A and the second insulation patterns B form a plurality of the small lattices in combination. Thus formed small lattices cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B so that the visibility is improved.

In this embodiment in the terminal wiring region a plurality of the first terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the periphery on the one long side of the first conductive sheet A and a plurality of the second terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the periphery on the one long side of the second conductive sheet B. Particularly in the example of the first terminals and the second terminals do not overlap with each other but are close to each other and the first terminal wiring patterns and the second terminal wiring patterns do not overlap with each other. For example the first terminal may partially overlap with the odd numbered second terminal wiring pattern

Thus the first terminals and the second terminals can be electrically connected to the control circuit by using a cable and two connectors a connector for the first terminals and a connector for the second terminals or one connector a complex connector to be connected to the first terminals and the second terminals .

Since the first terminal wiring patterns and the second terminal wiring patterns do not vertically overlap with each other a parasitic capacitance generation is reduced therebetween so that the response speed deterioration is prevented.

Since the first wire connections are arranged along the one long side of the sensing region and the second wire connections are arranged along both the short sides of the sensing region the area of the terminal wiring region can be reduced. Therefore the size of the display panel containing the touch panel can be easily reduced and the display screen can be made to seem larger. Also the operability of the touch panel can be improved.

The area of the terminal wiring region may be further reduced by reducing the distance between the adjacent first terminal wiring patterns or the adjacent second terminal wiring patterns . The distance is preferably 10 to 50 m in view of preventing migration.

Alternatively the area of the terminal wiring region may be reduced by arranging the second terminal wiring pattern between the adjacent first terminal wiring patterns as viewed from above. However when the pattern is misaligned the first terminal wiring pattern may vertically overlap with the second terminal wiring pattern so that the parasitic capacitance therebetween becomes disadvantageously increased. This leads to the response speed deterioration. Thus in the case of using such an arrangement the distance between the adjacent first terminal wiring patterns is preferably 50 to 100 m.

Consequently when the first laminated conductive sheet A is used in the projected capacitive touch panel or the like the response speed and the size of the touch panel can be easily increased.

The combination of the first dummy patterns A formed around the first large lattices A in the first conductive sheet A and the second dummy patterns B formed around the second large lattices B in the second conductive sheet B the combination of the first connections A and the second connections B and the combination of the first insulation patterns A and the second insulation patterns B form a plurality of the small lattices . Therefore the boundaries between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A and the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B can be made less visible defects such as the local line thickening can be prevented and the overall visibility can be improved.

Furthermore the CR time constant of a large number of the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B can be significantly reduced whereby the response speed can be increased and the position detection can be readily carried out in an operation time a scan time . Thus the screen sizes not the thickness but the length and width of the touch panel can be easily increased.

Though the first large lattice A has a rectangular outer shape as shown in and the second large lattice B has an octagonal outer shape as shown in in the above example the outer shapes of the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B are not limited thereto. Also the sizes of the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B are not particularly limited as long as the sizes are sufficient for detecting the touch position.

Though the small lattice has a square shape in the above example it may have another polygonal shape. Each side of the small lattice may have a straight line shape a curved shape or an arc shape. When the small lattice has an arc shaped side for example two opposite sides may have an outwardly protruding arc shape and the other two opposite sides may have an inwardly protruding arc shape. Alternatively each side may have a wavy shape containing outwardly protruding arcs and inwardly protruding arcs continuously. Of course each side may have a sine curve shape.

Though the arrangement pitch of the medium lattices in the first connections A and the second connections B is twice larger than the arrangement pitch P of the small lattices in the above first conductive sheet A and second conductive sheet B it may be appropriately selected depending on the number of the medium lattices . For example the arrangement pitch of the medium lattices may be 1.5 or 3 times larger than the arrangement pitch P of the small lattices . When the arrangement pitch of the medium lattices is excessively small or large it may be difficult to arrange the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B resulting in poor appearance. Thus the arrangement pitch of the medium lattices is preferably 1 to 10 times more preferably 1 to 5 times larger than the arrangement pitch P of the small lattices .

Also the sizes of the small lattices including the side length and the diagonal line length the number of the small lattices in the first large lattice A and the number of the small lattices in the second large lattice B may be appropriately selected depending on the size and the resolution the number of wires of the touch panel.

As shown in and A in the above first laminated conductive sheet A the first conductive patterns A are formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive patterns B are formed on one main surface of the second transparent substrate B. Alternatively as shown in the first conductive part A may be formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive part B may be formed on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A. In this case the second transparent substrate B is not used the first transparent substrate A is stacked on the second conductive part B and the first conductive part A is stacked on the first transparent substrate A. In addition another layer may be disposed between the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. The first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B may be arranged facing each other as long as they are insulated.

In a first structure example shown in the first laminated conductive sheet A shown in containing the first conductive part A the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive part B is stacked on the display device with a transparent adhesive interposed therebetween a hard coat layer is stacked on the first laminated conductive sheet A and further an antireflection layer is stacked on the hard coat layer . The transparent adhesive the second conductive part B the first transparent substrate A and the first conductive part A form the touch panel on the display device and the hard coat layer and the antireflection layer form an antireflection film on the touch panel .

In a second structure example shown in the first laminated conductive sheet A shown in and a protective resin layer are stacked on the display device with the transparent adhesive interposed therebetween the hard coat layer is stacked on the protective resin layer and further the antireflection layer is stacked on the hard coat layer . The transparent adhesive the second conductive part B the first transparent substrate A the first conductive part A and the protective resin layer form the touch panel on the display device and the hard coat layer and the antireflection layer form the antireflection film on the touch panel .

In a third structure example shown in the first laminated conductive sheet A shown in and a second transparent adhesive B are stacked on the display device with a first transparent adhesive A interposed therebetween a transparent film is stacked on the second transparent adhesive B the hard coat layer is stacked on the transparent film and further the antireflection layer is stacked on the hard coat layer . The first transparent adhesive A the second conductive part B the first transparent substrate A the first conductive part A and the second transparent adhesive B form the touch panel on the display device and the transparent film the hard coat layer and the antireflection layer form the antireflection film on the touch panel .

As shown in first alignment marks and second alignment marks are preferably formed for example on the corners of the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. The first alignment marks and the second alignment marks are used for positioning the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B in a bonding process. In a case where the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B are bonded to obtain the first laminated conductive sheet A composite alignment marks are formed by the first alignment marks and the second alignment marks . The composite alignment marks can be used for positioning the first laminated conductive sheet A in the process of attaching to the display panel .

A touch panel conductive sheet according to a second embodiment hereinafter referred to as the second laminated conductive sheet B will be described below with reference to .

As shown in the second laminated conductive sheet B has approximately the same structure as the above first laminated conductive sheet A but is different in the shapes of the first insulation pattern A in the first insulation A and the second insulation pattern B in the second insulation B.

As shown in the shape of the first assembly pattern portion in the first insulation pattern A is such that the first space see is filled with the second assembly pattern portion see . Thus the first assembly pattern portion is filled with the small lattices between the opposite short straight lines and the first insulation pattern A does not have the first space . As shown in the shape of the fourth space in the second insulation pattern B is such that the second assembly pattern portion see is removed. Thus the second insulation B has no small lattices .

For example as shown in in a case where the first conductive sheet A is stacked on the second conductive sheet B to form the second laminated conductive sheet B as in the first laminated conductive sheet A see the first connections A of the first conductive patterns A and the second connections B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A see interposed therebetween and the first insulations A of the first conductive patterns A and the second insulations B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A interposed therebetween. Though the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B have the same line width they are exaggeratingly shown by thick lines and thin lines respectively to clearly represent the positions thereof in as well as .

Particularly when the overlap of the first insulation pattern A of the first insulation A and the second insulation pattern B of the second insulation B is viewed from above the first assembly pattern portion of the first insulation pattern A is arranged facing the fourth space of the second insulation pattern B the second space of the first insulation pattern A is arranged facing the first bend pattern portion of the second insulation pattern B and the third space of the first insulation pattern A is arranged facing the second bend pattern portion of the second insulation pattern B. Consequently as in the first laminated conductive sheet A the first insulation patterns A and the second insulation patterns B form a plurality of the small lattices in combination. Thus formed small lattices cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B so that the visibility is improved.

Though not shown in the drawings the arrangement of the first wire connections and the second wire connections the arrangement of the first terminal wiring patterns and the second terminal wiring patterns in the terminal wiring region and the arrangement of the first terminals and the second terminals in the second laminated conductive sheet B are equal to those in the above first laminated conductive sheet A.

Consequently when the second laminated conductive sheet B using the second conductive sheet B is used in the projected capacitive touch panel or the like the response speed and the size of the touch panel can be easily increased. Furthermore the boundaries between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A and the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B can be made less visible defects such as the local line thickening can be prevented and the overall visibility can be improved.

A touch panel conductive sheet according to a third embodiment hereinafter referred to as the third laminated conductive sheet C will be described below with reference to .

As shown in the third laminated conductive sheet C has approximately the same structure as the above first laminated conductive sheet A but is different in the shapes of the first insulation pattern A in the first insulation A and the second insulation pattern B in the second insulation B.

As shown in in the first insulation pattern A four wavy lines a first wavy line to a fourth wavy line extending in the y direction are arranged in parallel. Each of the four wavy lines has such a structure that two sides of the small lattice are continuously arranged. Among the four wavy lines the ends of the outer first wavy line and the outer second wavy line are connected to the small lattices and the ends of the inner third wavy line and the inner fourth wavy line are not connected to the small lattices . The positions of the small lattices at the ends of the first wavy line and the second wavy line are equal to those at the ends of the long straight lines of the first insulation pattern A in the first laminated conductive sheet A see .

The adjacent first and third wavy lines and have the same wave shape pattern and the adjacent second and fourth wavy lines and have the same wave shape pattern . The outer first wavy line has a wave shape pattern opposite to that of the outer second wavy line and the inner third wavy line has a wave shape pattern opposite to that of the inner fourth wavy line

In the first insulation pattern A a first space is formed between the adjacent third and fourth wavy lines and a second space is formed between the adjacent first and third wavy lines and and a third space is formed between the adjacent second and fourth wavy lines and

On the other hand as shown in the second insulation pattern B has a first assembly pattern portion to be placed in the first space of the first insulation pattern A a fifth wavy line to be placed in the second space of the first insulation pattern A and a sixth wavy line to be placed in the third space of the first insulation pattern A. The first assembly pattern portion is connected to the first bend pattern portion and the second bend pattern portion and is formed by arranging two or more small lattices for example six small lattices to connect the vertices thereof.

The fifth wavy line in the second insulation pattern B has a wave shape pattern opposite to those of the first and third wavy lines and in the first insulation pattern A. Similarly the sixth wavy line in the second insulation pattern B has a wave shape pattern opposite to those of the second and fourth wavy lines and in the first insulation pattern A.

For example as shown in in a case where the first conductive sheet A is stacked on the second conductive sheet B to form the third laminated conductive sheet C as in the first laminated conductive sheet A see the first connections A of the first conductive patterns A and the second connections B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A see interposed therebetween and the first insulations A of the first conductive patterns A and the second insulations B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A interposed therebetween. Though the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B have the same line width they are exaggeratingly shown by thick lines and thin lines respectively to clearly represent the positions thereof in as well as .

Particularly when the overlap of the first insulation pattern A of the first insulation A and the second insulation pattern B of the second insulation B is viewed from above the first space of the first insulation pattern A is arranged facing the first assembly pattern portion of the second insulation pattern B the second space of the first insulation pattern A is arranged facing the fifth wavy line of the second insulation pattern B and the third space of the first insulation pattern A is arranged facing the sixth wavy line of the second insulation pattern B. Consequently as in the first laminated conductive sheet A the first insulation patterns A and the second insulation patterns B form a plurality of the small lattices in combination. Thus formed small lattices cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B so that the visibility is improved.

Though not shown in the drawings the arrangement of the first wire connections and the second wire connections the arrangement of the first terminal wiring patterns and the second terminal wiring patterns in the terminal wiring region and the arrangement of the first terminals and the second terminals in the third laminated conductive sheet C are equal to those in the above first laminated conductive sheet A.

Consequently when the third laminated conductive sheet C is used in the projected capacitive touch panel or the like the response speed and the size of the touch panel can be easily increased. Furthermore the boundaries between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A and the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B can be made less visible defects such as the local line thickening can be prevented and the overall visibility can be improved.

A touch panel conductive sheet according to a fourth embodiment hereinafter referred to as the fourth laminated conductive sheet D will be described below with reference to .

As shown in the first conductive sheet A is stacked on the second conductive sheet B in the fourth laminated conductive sheet D as in the first laminated conductive sheet A and the like. The first conductive sheet A has the first conductive part A formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive sheet B has the second conductive part B formed on one main surface of the second transparent substrate B.

As shown in the first conductive part A contains two or more first conductive patterns A and first dummy patterns A. The first conductive patterns A extend in the first direction the x direction are arranged in the second direction the y direction perpendicular to the first direction and each contain a large number of lattices. The first dummy patterns A are arranged around the first conductive patterns A.

The first conductive pattern A contains two or more first large lattices A connected in series in the first direction. The first large lattices A each contain a combination of two or more small lattices . The above first dummy pattern A is formed around each side of the first large lattice A and is not connected to the first large lattice A.

A first connection A is formed between each adjacent two of the first large lattices A to electrically connect the first large lattices A. When a third direction an m direction is defined as a direction bisecting the angle between the first and second directions and a fourth direction an n direction is defined as a direction perpendicular to the third direction the first connection A contains a medium lattice having a shape corresponding to k small lattices in which k is a real number larger than 1 arranged in the fourth direction. A first absent portion A a portion provided by removing one side from the small lattice is formed on the side of the first large lattice A perpendicular to the fourth direction adjacent to the medium lattice . In the example of the medium lattice has a shape corresponding to three small lattices arranged in the fourth direction.

Electrically isolated first insulations A are disposed between the adjacent first conductive patterns A.

The first dummy pattern A contains a plurality of first auxiliary wires A having an axis direction parallel to the third direction arranged along the side of the first large lattice A perpendicular to the third direction and a plurality of first auxiliary wires A having an axis direction parallel to the fourth direction arranged along the side of the first large lattice A perpendicular to the fourth direction. In the first insulation A two first L shaped patterns A are arranged facing each other each of the first L shaped patterns A being formed by combining two first auxiliary wires A into an L shape.

The axis direction length of each first auxiliary wire A is or less preferably or less of the inside side length of the small lattice . The first auxiliary wire A is positioned at a predetermined distance from the first large lattice A. The predetermined distance is a difference obtained by subtracting the axis direction length of the first auxiliary wire A from the inside side length of the small lattice . For example when the axis direction length of the first auxiliary wire A is or of the inside side length of the small lattice the predetermined distance is or of the inside side length.

As shown in in the first conductive sheet A having the above described structure in one end of each first conductive pattern A the first connection A is not formed on the open end of the first large lattice A. In the other end of the first conductive pattern A the end of the first large lattice A is electrically connected to the first terminal wiring pattern composed of the thin metal wire by the first wire connection

Thus as shown in in the first conductive sheet A used in the touch panel a large number of the first conductive patterns A are arranged in the sensing region and a plurality of the first terminal wiring patterns extending from the first wire connections are arranged in the terminal wiring region .

On the other hand as shown in the second conductive part B of the second conductive sheet B contains two or more second conductive patterns B and second dummy patterns B. The second conductive patterns B each extend in the second direction the y direction are arranged in the first direction the x direction and each contain a large number of lattices. The second dummy patterns B are arranged around the second conductive patterns B.

The second conductive pattern B contains two or more second large lattices B connected in series in the second direction. The second large lattices B each contain a combination of two or more small lattices . The above second dummy pattern B is formed around each side of the second large lattice B and is not connected to the second large lattice B.

A second connection B is formed between each adjacent two of the second large lattices B to electrically connect the second large lattices B. The second connection B contains a medium lattice having a shape corresponding to k small lattices in which k is a real number larger than 1 arranged in the third direction. A second absent portion B a portion provided by removing one side from the small lattice is formed on the side of the second large lattice B perpendicular to the third direction adjacent to the medium lattice .

Electrically isolated second insulations B are disposed between the adjacent second conductive patterns B.

The second dummy pattern B contains a plurality of second auxiliary wires B having an axis direction parallel to the fourth direction arranged along the side of the second large lattice B perpendicular to the fourth direction and a plurality of second auxiliary wires B having an axis direction parallel to the third direction arranged along the side of the second large lattice B perpendicular to the third direction. In the second insulation B two second L shaped patterns B are arranged facing each other each of the second L shaped patterns B being formed by combining two second auxiliary wires B into an L shape.

The axis direction length of each second auxiliary wire B is or less preferably or less of the inside side length of the small lattice like the first auxiliary wire A. The second auxiliary wire B is positioned at a predetermined distance from the second large lattice B. The predetermined distance is a difference obtained by subtracting the axis direction length of the second auxiliary wire B from the inside side length of the small lattice as in the first auxiliary wire A. For example when the axis direction length of the second auxiliary wire B is or of the inside side length of the small lattice the predetermined distance is or of the inside side length.

As shown in in the second conductive sheet B having the above described structure in an end of each second conductive pattern B the second connection B is not formed on the open end of the second large lattice B. In the other end of each odd numbered second conductive pattern B and in the one end of each even numbered second conductive pattern B the end of the second large lattice B is electrically connected to the second terminal wiring pattern composed of the thin metal wire by the second wire connection

Thus in the second conductive sheet B used in the touch panel a large number of the second conductive patterns B are arranged in the sensing region and a plurality of the second terminal wiring patterns extending from the second wire connections are arranged in the terminal wiring region .

For example as shown in in a case where the first conductive sheet A is stacked on the second conductive sheet B to form the fourth laminated conductive sheet D the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are crossed. Specifically the first connections A of the first conductive patterns A and the second connections B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A see interposed therebetween and also the first insulations A of the first conductive part A and the second insulations B of the second conductive part B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A interposed therebetween.

When the fourth laminated conductive sheet D is viewed from above as shown in spaces between the first large lattices A on the first conductive sheet A are filled with the second large lattices B on the second conductive sheet B. In this case the first dummy patterns A and the second dummy patterns B overlap with each other to form combined patterns between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B. As shown in in the combined pattern a first axis line A of the first auxiliary wire A corresponds to the second axis line B of the second auxiliary wire B the first auxiliary wire A does not overlap with the second auxiliary wire B and an end of the first auxiliary wire A corresponds to an end of the second auxiliary wire B to form one side of the small lattice . Thus the combined pattern contains a combination of two or more small lattices similarly to the inner patterns of the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B. As a result when the fourth laminated conductive sheet D is viewed from above as shown in the sensing region is covered with a large number of the small lattices . As shown in the projected distance Lf between the side of the first large lattice A and the long side of the second large lattice B is approximately equal to the side length of the small lattice to advantageously lower the parasitic capacitance.

Though not shown in the drawings the arrangement of the first wire connections and the second wire connections the arrangement of the first terminal wiring patterns and the second terminal wiring patterns in the terminal wiring region and the arrangement of the first terminals and the second terminals in the fourth laminated conductive sheet D are equal to those in the above first laminated conductive sheet A.

Consequently when the fourth laminated conductive sheet D is used in the projected capacitive touch panel or the like the response speed and the size of the touch panel can be easily increased. Furthermore the boundaries between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A and the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B can be made less visible defects such as the local line thickening can be prevented and the overall visibility can be improved.

As shown in the fourth laminated conductive sheet D may be disposed such that the first and second conductive patterns are crossed and displaced in a direction different from the first direction the x direction and the second direction the y direction . In this case as at least shown in in the combined pattern formed by arranging the first dummy pattern A and the second dummy pattern B facing each other the first auxiliary wires A and the second auxiliary wires B are not perpendicularly crossed.

Thus as shown in in the combined pattern the combination of the first auxiliary wires A arranged along a side of the first large lattice A and the second auxiliary wires B arranged along a side of the second large lattice B is provided such that the first axis line A of the first auxiliary wire A and the second axis line B of the second auxiliary wire B are arranged approximately in parallel and the distance ha between the first axis line A and the second axis line B in the view from above is at least of the smaller line width among the line width Wa of the first auxiliary wire A and the line width Wb of the second auxiliary wire B and at most 100 m or at most of the arrangement pitch of the small lattices .

In the distance ha between the first axis line A and the second axis line B is smaller than the total of of the line width Wa of the first auxiliary wire A and of the line width Wb of the second auxiliary wire B. In this case the first auxiliary wire A and the second auxiliary wire B partially overlap with each other. In the distance ha between the first axis line A and the second axis line B is equal to the total of of the line width Wa of the first auxiliary wire A and of the line width Wb of the second auxiliary wire B. In the distance ha between the first axis line A and the second axis line B is larger than the total of of the line width Wa of the first auxiliary wire A and of the line width Wb of the second auxiliary wire B.

In the combined pattern the first auxiliary wires A of the two first L shaped patterns A in the first insulation A and the second auxiliary wires B of the two second L shaped patterns B in the second insulation B do not form the small lattices but form four L shaped patterns A A B B .

Thus as shown in one second L shaped pattern B is positioned closer to the two first L shaped patterns A and the other second L shaped pattern B is positioned away from the one second L shaped pattern B and the two first L shaped patterns A. The second axis line B of one of the two second auxiliary wires B in the one second L shaped pattern B is approximately parallel to the first axis line A of one of the two first auxiliary wires A in one of the two first L shaped patterns A and the distance ha between the first axis line A and the second axis line B is at least of the smaller line width among the line width Wa of the first auxiliary wire A and the line width Wb of the second auxiliary wire B and at most 100 m or at most of the arrangement pitch of the small lattices .

Similarly the second axis line B of the other second auxiliary wire B in the one second L shaped pattern B is approximately parallel to the first axis line A of one of the two first auxiliary wires A in the other first L shaped pattern A and the distance ha between the first axis line A and the second axis line B is at least of the smaller line width among the line width Wa of the first auxiliary wire A and the line width Wb of the second auxiliary wire B and at most 100 m or at most of the arrangement pitch of the small lattices . The positional relations of the second auxiliary wires B and the first auxiliary wires A in the one second L shaped pattern B and the two first L shaped patterns A are such as those shown in .

Thus the first conductive part A or the second conductive part B is displaced by a shift length from the standard position at least in the third direction the shift length being at least of the smaller line width among the line width Wa of the first auxiliary wire A and the line width Wb of the second auxiliary wire B and at most 100 m or at most of the arrangement pitch of the small lattices . Particularly in this embodiment it is displaced by the shift length in each of the third and fourth directions the shift length being at least of the smaller line width among the line width Wa of the first auxiliary wire A and the line width Wb of the second auxiliary wire B and at most 100 m or at most of the arrangement pitch of the small lattices .

The standard position is such a position that as shown in described above the first axis line A of the first auxiliary wire A corresponds to the second axis line B of the second auxiliary wire B the first auxiliary wire A does not overlap with the second auxiliary wire B and the end of the first auxiliary wire A corresponds to the end of the second auxiliary wire B.

Thus in the fourth laminated conductive sheet D as shown in the combined patterns of the first dummy patterns A and the second dummy patterns B are arranged between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B so that blank areas having a width corresponding to the side length of the small lattice and a length corresponding to the side length of the first large lattice A or the second large lattice B are not formed between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B and the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are less visible.

In the combined pattern the first auxiliary wires A and the second auxiliary wires B having a length of of the inside side length of the small lattices are partially overlapped and the lengths of the overlaps are significantly smaller than the side length of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B 1 20 or less of the side length . Therefore the overlaps of the first auxiliary wires A and the second auxiliary wires B are not highly visible thereby not deteriorating the visibility. Also the first L shaped patterns A and the second L shaped patterns B are arranged in the same manner. As shown in in the one second L shaped pattern B and the two first L shaped patterns A the first auxiliary wires A and the second auxiliary wires B having the length of of the inside side length of the small lattices are partially overlapped and the lengths of the overlaps are significantly smaller than the side length of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B 1 20 or less of the side length . Therefore the overlaps of the first auxiliary wires A and the second auxiliary wires B are not highly visible thereby not deteriorating the visibility.

The first auxiliary wires A and the second auxiliary wires B may perpendicularly cross the sides of the second large lattices B and the first large lattices A respectively. Since the axis direction lengths of the first auxiliary wires A and the second auxiliary wires B are of the inside side length of the small lattices they are not highly visible.

The medium lattices of the first connection A and the second connection B are perpendicularly crossed and overlap with each other. In this example since the first conductive part A or the second conductive part B is displaced in the third and fourth directions the small lattices are not uniformly shaped in the overlaps. However the number of the misshapen small lattices is significantly smaller than approximately 5 of the number of the small lattices in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B around the overlaps of the perpendicularly crossed medium lattices of the first connections A and the second connections B whereby the nonuniformity of the small lattices are not highly visible. Furthermore since the first absent portions A and the second absent portions B are formed adjacent to the medium lattices in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B the straight lines of the medium lattices do not overlap with the straight lines of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B and the visibility is hardly deteriorated.

Therefore even in a case where the first conductive part A or the second conductive part B is displaced as described above the boundaries between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A and the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B can be made less visible defects such as the local line thickening can be prevented and the overall visibility can be improved. In addition the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are arranged adjacent to each other to form a regular arrangement of the small lattices and the first auxiliary wires A or the second auxiliary wires B are displaced to form another arrangement between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B so that the different arrangements are combined in the fourth laminated conductive sheet D. Thus many spatial frequencies are combined whereby the interference with a pixel array of the liquid crystal display device or the like can be prevented and the moire generation can be effectively prevented.

Though the size of the medium lattices in the first connections A and the second connections B corresponds to the total of three small lattices in the above described first conductive sheet A and second conductive sheet B the size may correspond to 1.5 2 or 2.5 times the size of the small lattices etc. When the medium lattices have an excessively large size it is difficult to arrange the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B and the electrostatic capacitance change is increased in the overlaps which should not be detected. Therefore the size of the medium lattices is preferably at most the total size of five small lattices .

Also in the fourth laminated conductive sheet D as shown in the first conductive part A may be formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive part B may be formed on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A.

Though the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B are used in the projected capacitive touch panel in the above embodiments they can be used in a surface capacitive touch panel or a resistive touch panel.

The first conductive part A and the second conductive part B may be formed in the following manner. For example a photosensitive material having the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B and thereon a photosensitive silver halide containing emulsion layer is exposed and developed whereby metallic silver portions and light transmitting portions are formed in the exposed areas and the unexposed areas respectively to obtain the first conductive part A or the second conductive part B. The metallic silver portions may be subjected to a physical development treatment and or a plating treatment to deposit a conductive metal thereon.

As shown in the first conductive part A may be formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive part B may be formed on the other main surface thereof. In this case if the one main surface is exposed and then the other main surface is exposed in the usual method the first conductive part A and the second conductive part B often cannot be obtained with desired patterns. In particular it is difficult to uniformly form the first dummy pattern A around the side of the first large lattice A and the first insulation pattern A in the first insulation A shown in etc. the second dummy pattern B around the long side of the second large lattice B and the second insulation pattern B in the second insulation B shown in etc. the pattern of a large number of the first auxiliary wires A arranged along the side of the first large lattice A and the first L shaped pattern A in the first insulation A shown in and the pattern of a large number of the second auxiliary wires B arranged along the side of the second large lattice B and the second L shaped pattern B in the second insulation B shown in and the like.

Thus the first conductive part A on the one main surface and the second conductive part B on the other main surface are formed by subjecting photosensitive silver halide emulsion layers formed on either side of the first transparent substrate A to one shot exposure.

First in the step S of a long photosensitive material is prepared. As shown in the photosensitive material has the first transparent substrate A a photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A hereinafter referred to as the first photosensitive layer and a photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer formed on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A hereinafter referred to as the second photosensitive layer .

In the step S of the photosensitive material is exposed. In this step a simultaneous both side exposure is carried out the exposure including a first exposure treatment for irradiating the first photosensitive layer on the first transparent substrate A with a light in a first exposure pattern and a second exposure treatment for irradiating the second photosensitive layer on the first transparent substrate A with a light in a second exposure pattern. In the example of the first photosensitive layer is irradiated through a first photomask with a first light a parallel light and the second photosensitive layer is irradiated through a second photomask with a second light a parallel light while conveying the long photosensitive material in one direction. The first light is obtained such that a light from a first light source is converted to the parallel light by an intermediate first collimator lens and the second light is obtained such that a light from a second light source is converted to the parallel light by an intermediate second collimator lens . Though the two light sources the first light source and the second light source are used in the example of only one light source may be used. In this case a light from the one light source may be divided by an optical system into the first light and the second light for exposing the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer

In the step S of the exposed photosensitive material is developed to produce the first laminated conductive sheet A shown in etc. The first laminated conductive sheet A has the first transparent substrate A the first conductive part A including the first conductive patterns A formed in the first exposure pattern on the one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive part B including the second conductive patterns B formed in the second exposure pattern on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A. Preferred exposure time and development time for the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer vary depending on the types of the first light source the second light source and a developer etc. and cannot be categorically determined. The exposure time and development time may be selected in view of achieving a development ratio of 100 .

As shown in in the first exposure treatment in the production method of this embodiment for example the first photomask is placed in close contact with the first photosensitive layer the first light source is arranged facing the first photomask and the first light is emitted from the first light source toward the first photomask so that the first photosensitive layer is exposed. The first photomask has a glass substrate composed of a transparent soda glass and a mask pattern a first exposure pattern formed thereon. Therefore in the first exposure treatment areas in the first photosensitive layer corresponding to the first exposure pattern in the first photomask are exposed. A space of approximately 2 to 10 m may be formed between the first photosensitive layer and the first photomask

Similarly in the second exposure treatment for example the second photomask is placed in close contact with the second photosensitive layer the second light source is arranged facing the second photomask and the second light is emitted from the second light source toward the second photomask so that the second photosensitive layer is exposed. The second photomask as well as the first photomask has a glass substrate composed of a transparent soda glass and a mask pattern a second exposure pattern formed thereon. Therefore in the second exposure treatment areas in the second photosensitive layer corresponding to the second exposure pattern in the second photomask are exposed. In this case a space of approximately 2 to 10 m may be formed between the second photosensitive layer and the second photomask

In the first and second exposure treatments the emission of the first light from the first light source and the emission of the second light from the second light source may be carried out simultaneously or independently. In a case where the emissions are simultaneously carried out the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer can be simultaneously exposed in one exposure process resulting in reduction of the treatment time.

In a case where both of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are not spectrally sensitized a light incident on one side may affect the image formation on the other side the back side in the both side exposure of the photosensitive material .

Thus the first light from the first light source reaches the first photosensitive layer and is scattered by silver halide particles in the first photosensitive layer and a part of the scattered light is transmitted through the first transparent substrate A and reaches the second photosensitive layer . Then a large area of the boundary between the second photosensitive layer and the first transparent substrate A is exposed to form a latent image. As a result the second photosensitive layer is exposed to the second light from the second light source and the first light from the first light source . In a case where the second photosensitive layer is developed to prepare the first laminated conductive sheet A the conductive pattern corresponding to the second exposure pattern the second conductive part B is formed and additionally a thin conductive layer is formed due to the first light from the first light source between the conductive patterns so that the desired pattern corresponding to the second exposure pattern cannot be obtained. This is true also for the first photosensitive layer

As a result of intense research in view of solving this problem it has been found that if the thicknesses and the applied silver amounts of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are selected within particular ranges the incident light can be absorbed by the silver halide to suppress the light transmission to the back side. In this embodiment the thicknesses of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer may be 1 to 4 . The upper limit is preferably 2.5 m. The applied silver amounts of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer may be 5 to 20 g m.

In the above described both side contact exposure technology the exposure may be inhibited by dust or the like attached to the film surface so that an image defect is generated. It is known that the dust attachment can be prevented by applying a conductive substance such as a metal oxide or a conductive polymer to the film. However the metal oxide or the like remaining in the processed product deteriorates the transparency of the final product and the conductive polymer is disadvantageous in storage stability etc. As a result of intense research it has been found that a silver halide layer with reduced binder content exhibits a satisfactory conductivity for static charge prevention. Thus the volume ratio of silver binder is limited in the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer . The silver binder volume ratios of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are 1 1 or more preferably 2 1 or more.

In a case where the thicknesses the applied silver amounts and the silver binder volume ratios of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are selected as described above the first light emitted from the first light source to the first photosensitive layer does not reach the second photosensitive layer as shown in . Similarly the second light emitted from the second light source to the second photosensitive layer does not reach the first photosensitive layer . As a result in the following development for producing the first laminated conductive sheet A as shown in only the conductive pattern corresponding to the first exposure pattern the pattern of the first conductive part A is formed on the one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and only the conductive pattern corresponding to the second exposure pattern the pattern of the second conductive part B is formed on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A so that the desired patterns can be obtained.

In the production method using the above one shot both side exposure the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer can have both of the satisfactory conductivity and both side exposure suitability and the same or different patterns can be formed on either side of the first transparent substrate A by the exposure whereby the electrodes of the touch panel can be easily formed and the touch panel can be made thinner smaller .

In the above production method the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are formed using the photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer. The other examples of the production methods include the following methods.

A photoresist film disposed on a copper foil on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B may be exposed and developed to form a resist pattern and the copper foil exposed from the resist pattern may be etched to obtain the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B.

Alternatively a paste containing fine metal particles may be printed on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B and the printed paste may be plated with a metal to obtain the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B.

The first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B may be printed on the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B by using a screen or gravure printing plate.

The first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B may be formed on the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B by using an inkjet method.

A particularly preferred method which contains using a photographic photosensitive silver halide material for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B according to this embodiment will be mainly described below.

The method for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment includes the following three processes different in the photosensitive materials and development treatments.

 1 A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black and white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei to a chemical or thermal development to form the metallic silver portions on the material.

 2 A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black and white silver halide material having a silver halide emulsion layer containing physical development nuclei to a solution physical development to form the metallic silver portions on the material.

 3 A process comprising subjecting a stack of a photosensitive black and white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei and an image receiving sheet having a non photosensitive layer containing physical development nuclei to a diffusion transfer development to form the metallic silver portions on the non photosensitive image receiving sheet.

In the process of 1 an integral black and white development procedure is employed to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material. The resulting silver is a chemically or thermally developed silver containing a high specific surface area filament and thereby shows a high activity in the following plating or physical development treatment.

In the process of 2 the silver halide particles are melted around and deposited on the physical development nuclei in the exposed areas to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material. Also in this process an integral black and white development procedure is employed. Though high activity can be achieved since the silver halide is deposited on the physical development nuclei in the development the developed silver has a spherical shape with small specific surface.

In the process of 3 the silver halide particles are melted in the unexposed areas and are diffused and deposited on the development nuclei of the image receiving sheet to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light transmitting conductive film on the sheet. In this process a so called separate type procedure is employed the image receiving sheet being peeled off from the photosensitive material.

A negative or reversal development treatment can be used in the processes. In the diffusion transfer development the negative development treatment can be carried out using an auto positive photosensitive material.

The chemical development thermal development solution physical development and diffusion transfer development have the meanings generally known in the art and are explained in common photographic chemistry texts such as Shin ichi Kikuchi Kyoritsu Shuppan Co. Ltd. 1955 and C. E. K. Mees 4. Mcmillan 1977. A liquid treatment is generally used in the present invention and also a thermal development treatment may be utilized. For example techniques described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 2004 184693 2004 334077 and 2005 010752 and Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2004 244080 and 2004 085655 can be used in the present invention.

The structure of each layer in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment will be described in detail below.

The first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B may be a plastic film a plastic plate a glass plate etc.

Examples of materials for the plastic film and the plastic plate include polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalates PET and polyethylene naphthalates PEN polyolefins such as polyethylenes PE polypropylenes PP polystyrenes and EVA vinyl resins polycarbonates PC polyamides polyimides acrylic resins and triacetyl celluloses TAC .

The first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B are preferably a film or plate of a plastic having a melting point of about 290 C. or lower such as PET melting point 258 C. PEN melting point 269 C. PE melting point 135 C. PP melting point 163 C. polystyrene melting point 230 C. polyvinyl chloride melting point 180 C. polyvinylidene chloride melting point 212 C. or TAC melting point 290 C. . The PET is particularly preferred from the viewpoints of light transmittance workability etc. The conductive film such as the first conductive sheet A or the second conductive sheet B used in the first to third laminated conductive sheets A to C is required to be transparent and therefore the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B preferably have a high transparency.

The silver salt emulsion layer to be converted to a conductive layer in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B a conductive portion such as the first large lattice A the first connection A the first insulation pattern A in the first insulation A the second large lattice B the second connection B the second insulation pattern B in the second insulation B or the small lattice contains a silver salt and a binder and may further contain a solvent and an additive such as a dye.

The silver salt used in this embodiment may be an inorganic silver salt such as a silver halide or an organic silver salt such as silver acetate. In this embodiment the silver halide is preferred because of its excellent light sensing property.

The applied silver amount the amount of the applied silver salt in the silver density of the silver salt emulsion layer is preferably 1 to 30 g m more preferably 1 to 25 g m further preferably 5 to 20 g m. When the applied silver amount is within this range the resultant first to third laminated conductive sheets A to C can exhibit a desired surface resistance.

Examples of the binders used in this embodiment include gelatins polyvinyl alcohols PVA polyvinyl pyrolidones PVP polysaccharides such as starches celluloses and derivatives thereof polyethylene oxides polyvinylamines chitosans polylysines polyacrylic acids polyalginic acids polyhyaluronic acids and carboxycelluloses. The binders show a neutral anionic or cationic property depending on the ionicity of the functional group.

In this embodiment the amount of the binder in the silver salt emulsion layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected to obtain sufficient dispersion and adhesion properties. The volume ratio of silver binder in the silver salt emulsion layer is preferably or more more preferably or more. The silver binder volume ratio is preferably 100 1 or less more preferably 50 1 or less. Particularly the silver binder volume ratio is further preferably 1 1 to 4 1 most preferably 1 1 to 3 1. When the silver binder volume ratio of the silver salt emulsion layer is within the range the resistance variation can be reduced even under various applied silver amount whereby the first to third laminated conductive sheets A to C can be produced with a uniform surface resistance. The silver binder volume ratio can be obtained by converting the silver halide binder weight ratio of the material to the silver binder weight ratio and by further converting the silver binder weight ratio to the silver binder volume ratio.

The solvent used for forming the silver salt emulsion layer is not particularly limited and examples thereof include water organic solvents e.g. alcohols such as methanol ketones such as acetone amides such as formamide sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide esters such as ethyl acetate ethers ionic liquids and mixtures thereof.

In this embodiment the ratio of the solvent to the total of the silver salt the binder and the like in the silver salt emulsion layer is 30 to 90 by mass preferably 50 to 80 by mass.

The additive used in this embodiment is not particularly limited and may be preferably selected from known additives.

A protective layer not shown may be formed on the silver salt emulsion layer. The protective layer used in this embodiment contains a binder such as a gelatin or a high molecular polymer and is disposed on the photosensitive silver salt emulsion layer to improve the scratch prevention or mechanical property. The thickness of the protective layer is preferably 0.5 m or less. The method of applying or forming the protective layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected from known applying or forming methods. In addition an undercoat layer or the like may be formed below the silver salt emulsion layer.

The steps for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B will be described below.

In this embodiment the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B may be formed in a printing process and may be formed by exposure and development treatments etc. in another process. Thus a photosensitive material having the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B and thereon the silver salt containing layer or a photosensitive material coated with a photopolymer for photolithography is subjected to the exposure treatment. An electromagnetic wave may be used in the exposure. For example the electromagnetic wave may be a light such as a visible light or an ultraviolet light or a radiation ray such as an X ray. The exposure may be carried out using a light source having a wavelength distribution or a specific wavelength.

In this embodiment the emulsion layer is subjected to the development treatment after the exposure. Common development treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films photographic papers print engraving films emulsion masks for photomasking and the like may be used in the present invention. The developer used in the development treatment is not particularly limited and may be a PQ developer an MQ developer an MAA developer etc. Examples of commercially available developers usable in the present invention include CN 16 CR 56 CP45X FD 3 and PAPITOL available from FUJIFILM Corporation C 41 E 6 RA 4 D 19 and D 72 available from Eastman Kodak Company and developers contained in kits thereof.

The fixation time is preferably 5 seconds to 1 minute more preferably 7 to 50 seconds. The amount of the fixer used is preferably 600 ml mor less more preferably 500 ml mor less particularly preferably 300 ml mor less per 1 mof the photosensitive material treated.

The developed and fixed photosensitive material is preferably subjected to a water washing treatment or a stabilization treatment. The amount of water used in the water washing or stabilization treatment is generally 20 L or less and may be 3 L or less per 1 mof the photosensitive material. The water amount may be 0 and thus the photosensitive material may be washed with storage water.

The ratio of the metallic silver contained in the exposed areas after the development to the silver contained in the areas before the exposure is preferably 50 or more more preferably 80 or more by mass. When the ratio is 50 or more by mass a high conductivity can be achieved.

In this embodiment the tone gradation obtained by the development is preferably more than 4.0 though not particularly restrictive. When the tone is more than 4.0 after the development the conductivity of the conductive metal portion can be increased while maintaining the high transmittance of the light transmitting portion. For example the tone of 4.0 or more can be obtained by doping with rhodium or iridium ion.

The conductive sheet is obtained by the above steps. The surface resistance of the resultant conductive sheet is preferably within the range of 0.1 to 100 ohm sq. The lower limit is preferably 1 ohm sq or more 3 ohm sq or more 5 ohm sq or more or 10 ohm sq. The upper limit is preferably 70 ohm sq or less or 50 ohm sq or less. When the surface resistance is controlled within this range the position detection can be performed even in a large touch panel having an area of 10 cm 10 cm or more.

In this embodiment to increase the conductivity of the metallic silver portion formed by the above exposure and development treatments conductive metal particles may be deposited thereon by a physical development treatment and or a plating treatment. In the present invention the conductive metal particles may be deposited on the metallic silver portion by only one of the physical development and plating treatments or by the combination of the treatments. The metallic silver portion subjected to the physical development treatment and or the plating treatment in this manner is also referred to as the conductive metal portion.

In this embodiment the physical development is such a process that metal ions such as silver ions are reduced by a reducing agent whereby metal particles are deposited on a metal or metal compound core. Such physical development has been used in the fields of instant B W film instant slide film printing plate production etc. and the technologies can be used in the present invention.

The physical development may be carried out at the same time as the above development treatment after the exposure and may be carried out after the development treatment separately.

In this embodiment the plating treatment may contain electroless plating such as chemical reduction plating or displacement plating electrolytic plating or a combination thereof.

In this embodiment the metallic silver portion formed by the development treatment or the conductive metal portion formed by the physical development treatment and or the plating treatment is preferably subjected to an oxidation treatment. For example by the oxidation treatment a small amount of a metal deposited on the light transmitting portion can be removed so that the transmittance of the light transmitting portion can be increased to approximately 100 .

In this embodiment as described above the lower limit of the line width of the conductive metal portion is preferably 1 m or more 3 m or more 4 m or more or 5 m or more and the upper limit thereof is preferably 15 m or less 10 m or less 9 m or less or 8 m or less. In a case where the line width is less than the lower limit the conductive metal portion has an insufficient conductivity whereby a touch panel using the conductive part has an insufficient detection sensitivity. On the other hand in a case where the line width is more than the upper limit moire is significantly generated due to the conductive metal portion and a touch panel using the conductive part has a poor visibility. In a case where the line width is within the above range the moire of the conductive metal portion is improved and the visibility is remarkably improved. The line distance the distance between the sides facing each other in the small lattice is preferably 30 to 500 m more preferably 50 to 400 m most preferably 100 to 350 m. The conductive metal portion may have a part with a line width of more than 200 m for the purpose of ground connection etc.

In this embodiment the opening ratio of the conductive metal portion is preferably 85 or more more preferably 90 or more most preferably 95 or more in view of the visible light transmittance. The opening ratio is the ratio of the light transmitting portions other than the conductive portions such as the first large lattices A the first connections A the first insulation patterns A in the first insulations A the second large lattices B the second connections B the second insulation patterns B in the second insulations B the small lattices and the like to the entire surface. For example a square lattice having a line width of 15 m and a pitch of 300 m has an opening ratio of 90 .

In this embodiment the light transmitting portion is a portion having light transmittance other than the conductive metal portions in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. The transmittance of the light transmitting portion which is herein a minimum transmittance value in a wavelength region of 380 to 780 nm obtained neglecting the light absorption and reflection of the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B is 90 or more preferably 95 or more more preferably 97 or more further preferably 98 or more most preferably 99 or more.

The exposure is preferably carried out using a glass mask method or a laser lithography pattern exposure method.

In the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment the thicknesses of the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B are preferably 5 to 350 m more preferably 30 to 150 m. In a case where the thicknesses are 5 to 350 m a desired visible light transmittance can be obtained and the substrates can be easily handled.

The thickness of the metallic silver portion formed on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B may be appropriately selected by controlling the thickness of the coating liquid for the silver salt containing layer applied to the substrate. The thickness of the metallic silver portion may be selected within a range of 0.001 to 0.2 mm and is preferably 30 m or less more preferably 20 m or less further preferably 0.01 to 9 m most preferably 0.05 to 5 m. The metallic silver portion is preferably formed in a patterned shape. The metallic silver portion may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure containing two or more layers. In a case where the metallic silver portion has a patterned multilayer structure containing two or more layers the layers may have different wavelength color sensitivities. In this case different patterns can be formed in the layers by using exposure lights with different wavelengths.

In a touch panel the conductive metal portion preferably has a smaller thickness. As the thickness is reduced the viewing angle and visibility of the display panel are improved. Thus the thickness of the layer of the conductive metal deposited on the conductive metal portion is preferably less than 9 m more preferably 0.1 m or more but less than 5 m further preferably 0.1 m or more but less than 3 m.

In this embodiment the thickness of the metallic silver portion can be controlled by changing the coating thickness of the silver salt containing layer and the thickness of the conductive metal particle layer can be controlled in the physical development treatment and or the plating treatment whereby the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B can be easily produced with a thickness of less than 5 m preferably less than 3 m .

The plating or the like is not necessarily carried out in the method for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment. This is because the desired surface resistance can be obtained by controlling the applied silver amount and the silver binder volume ratio of the silver salt emulsion layer in the method. The calender treatment or the like may be carried out if necessary.

It is preferred that after the silver salt emulsion layer is developed the resultant is immersed in a hardener and thus subjected to a film hardening treatment.

First and second conductive sheets of Reference Example 2 were produced in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 20 m the small lattices had a side length of 500 m and the large lattices had a side length of 10 mm in Samples 1 to 3.

In each of Examples 1 to 8 and Reference Examples 1 and 2 the surface resistance moire and visibility were evaluated. The evaluation results are shown in Table 3.

In each of the first conductive sheets A and the second conductive sheets B the surface resistivity values of optionally selected 10 areas were measured by LORESTA GP Model No. MCP T610 manufactured by Dia Instruments Co. Ltd. utilizing an in line four probe method ASP and the average of the measured values was obtained to evaluate the surface resistivity uniformity.

The transmittance of each of the first conductive sheets A and the second conductive sheets B was measured by a spectrophotometer to evaluate the transparency.

In each of Examples 1 to 8 and Reference Examples 1 and 2 the first conductive sheet A was stacked on the second conductive sheet B to obtain a laminated conductive sheet. The laminated conductive sheet was attached to a display screen of a display device to obtain a touch panel . The touch panel was fixed to a turntable and the display device was operated to display a white color. The moire of the laminated conductive sheet was visually observed and evaluated while turning the turntable within a bias angle range of 20 to 20 .

The moire was observed at a distance of 1.5 m from the display screen of the liquid crystal display device. The laminated conductive sheet was evaluated as Excellent when the moire was not visible as Fair when the moire was slightly visible to an acceptable extent or as Poor when the moire was highly visible.

In a condition where the touch panel was fixed to the turntable and the display device was operated to display the white color before the moire evaluation whether a thickened line or a black point was formed or not on the touch panel and whether boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B in the touch panel were visible or not were observed by the naked eye.

The exposure was carried out using a parallel light from a light source of a high pressure mercury lamp and photomasks having the above patterns.

The exposed photosensitive material was treated with the above treatment agents under the following treatment conditions using an automatic processor FG 710PTS manufactured by FUJIFILM Corporation. In this process a development treatment was carried out at 35 C. for 30 seconds a fixation treatment was carried out at 34 C. for 23 seconds and then a water washing treatment was carried out for 20 seconds at a water flow rate of 5 L min.

The first conductive sheet A was stacked on the second conductive sheet B to obtain a laminated conductive sheet and the laminated conductive sheet was attached to a display screen of a liquid crystal display device to produce a touch panel of Example 11.
