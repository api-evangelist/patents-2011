This application is a national stage application under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT US2011 22496 filed Jan. 26 2011.

As computer systems become more advanced the interaction between different types of data and network based applications becomes more involved. As an example many businesses and personal computer users have begun to automate processes using a computer that have typically been implemented manually on paper. Many of these automated processes are implemented on network based service applications that require a user to log in and to enter data into the network based service application. Sometimes the information that is to be entered is available on a paper document such that the user can enter the information to the network based service manually or can scan the paper document and upload the scanned document to a website.

In the example of a document can be provided to the network connected device . The document includes information content that can include any of a variety of forms of data. As an example the document can be a business card an invoice a map a photograph a handwritten note e.g. a napkin with handwriting on it or any type of document that includes some form of discernable information. The information content can be any information that may be included in the document such as a person s name an address a phone number an image of a person on a photograph a corporate logo handwritten text dollar amounts or any other type of information recorded on the document . For instance the document can be a physical hardcopy document and the network connected device can be configured to scan the document to generate a corresponding document file e.g. a bitmap image of the document . Alternatively the document be provided as an image file e.g. a digital photograph an output from an application running on another network coupled device which can be provided to the network connected device via the network . For example the document can be streamed or emailed to the network connected device that is configured as a printer. As further described herein the document can refer to a document file that is a soft copy e.g. an encoded representation of the document.

In the example of and as otherwise described herein a user can implement a document workflow from the network connected device such as via a user interface not shown on the network connected device . Thus the user can activate the document workflow via the network connected device to process on the document residing on the network connected device in a predetermined manner. The document workflow can thus be implemented to provide the information content directly from the network connected device to one or more service applications residing on the network such as in response to being scanned by or being sent to the network connected device . As an example the service application s can include a variety of services implemented via one or more websites on the Internet that provide a service by executing one or more actions based on information provided by the user to the website. For instance the service application s can correspond to social networking services personal webpages or other user accessible services. The service application s can be programmed to automatically execute one or more actions in response to the information content being provided to the service application s via the document workflow .

Implementation of the document workflow can be performed based on a set of application programming interfaces APIs . In the example of the APIs include a device API and a document processing API . The device API can be programmed as a device interface API with respect to the network connected device and one or more document services . The device API can access a core set of device functionality as to generate the document file in a predetermined format and resolution which can be defined according to processing requirements for a given document workflow.

The document processing API can be programmed to coordinate extraction of the information content from the document such that the information content can be provided as inputs to the appropriate service application s . For instance the document processing API can provide access to a core set of image processing functions and methods relative to the document file that is retrieved from the network connected device . The document processing API can operate to obtain and convert the information content to a form that is usable by the respective service application s for executing actions based on the information content .

To provide the information content to the service application s the document processing API can also invoke the document service s . The document service s can thus automatically provide the information content to the service application s as inputs. Thus the document service s provide interaction between the network connected device and the service application s via the APIs and such that the document workflow can input e.g. post selected information content to the service application s in a usable manner for the service application s to execute one or more user actions relative to the extracted information content . The particular actions performed can be user defined. Therefore the document workflow can be implemented automatically from the network connected device to perform steps that normally require a user to use a network browser via a computing device to access the service application s .

As an example a typical manner of implementing a document workflow could include the user manually scanning the document uploading the document onto the computing device accessing the service application s via the network browser and publishing the document or the information content from the document onto the service application s . Instead as described herein the user could simply provide the document to the network connected device via scanning streaming or emailing and can activate the document workflow via a user interface on the network connected device to automatically implement the functionality of the service application s with respect to the information content . It is to be understood that the activation of the document workflow can also be performed from other network connected devices such as the computing device or a wireless communication device e.g. cellular telephone gaming device or the like .

In the example of the document workflow demonstrates a user updating his or her contacts on a networking website based on a business card . The business card demonstrates the name of the new contact at demonstrated as John Doe having the position of VIP at a place of employment the XYZ Corporation as demonstrated at and respectively. The business card also includes contact information for John Doe in the form of an address at a phone number and an email address . The business card can correspond to the document in the example of that can be implemented in a document workflow . Thus each of the characteristics of the business card including the name the position the business the address the phone number and the email address can correspond to information content of the document . Such characteristics can exist at various locations depending on the layout of the given business card .

A user can provide the business card to a network connected device . As one example the network connected device can be or can include a document scanner such that the user can scan the business card to generate a document file corresponding to the business card . As another example the network connected device can be or can include a printer such that the user or an application can email or stream a document file of the business card to the printer. The user can activate the document workflow from a user interface on the network connected device for processing the business card. As an example the user can program the user interface of the network connected device to access a business card or add to contacts workflow which can be predefined for the user such as described herein. The user interface can activate the document workflow e.g. via the user interface element for automatically obtaining document information from the business card and posting it to a desired service application s for the user. Alternatively the user can enter information for accessing the document workflow such as username password information and enter login data e.g. user ID and password for accessing a desired service application to which the business card is to be provided. In the example of the service application can be a networking website such that the business card can be added to a list of contacts.

In response to activating the document workflow the device API can negotiate the user provided information to the document service s through the network and can provide the document file of the business card to the document processing API . The document processing API can thus operate to extract the information content from the business card . As an example the document processing API can access third party software that is capable of extracting the specific text components of the business card and saving the extracted components as text strings via the document service s . In the example of the document processing API can thus extract the name the position the business the address the phone number and the email address as separate components of the information content of the business card . Thus functionality that can be performed locally on the user s computer can be pushed to the network and occur automatically via the document processing. API without knowledge of the user.

The document service s can provide the extracted information content to the networking website that corresponds to the service application . Thus the document workflow can be implemented to provide the components of the information content to respective inputs of the networking website such that the document workflow can update a contacts list with relevant information associated with the contact John Doe in the networking website.

In the example of the document workflow application demonstrates a graphical user interface GUI that corresponds to the networking website as accessible by the user via a network browser after implementation of the document workflow . The GUI includes a list of contacts . In response to activating the document workflow the contact list is automatically populated with the new contact John Doe based on the name being extracted from the business card and provided as an input to the networking website. For example the document processing API can coordinate with one or more of the document service s to recognize that the portion of the business card corresponding to the name is the name of the new contact and should thus be provided as an input contact name to the networking website. User login information for the user can be stored in a secure repository which can be accessed by the document services via the information provided from the document processing API in response to user activation of the given workflow via the GUI .

In addition the GUI includes a details section that provides details about a specific contact that is selected from the contact list . In the example of the contact John Doe is demonstrated as having been selected from the contact list . Thus the details section demonstrates details regarding the contact John Doe including the contact s name the company name as well as the contact s position address phone number and email address. Similar to as described above in response to activating the document workflow the details section is automatically populated with the position the business the address the phone number and the email address that are extracted from the business card and provided as inputs which are mapped to corresponding fields of the networking website. The details section also includes a section for additional contact information . The document services can organize and tag each unit of extracted information content in a desired format e.g. an XML document according to a predefined schema and provide such data to the networking website on behalf of the user. The additional contact information can correspond to additional information that is extracted from the business card by the document processing API or can correspond to notes regarding the contact that can be entered by the user into the network connected device at the time that the document workflow is activated or at a later time such as via a network browser.

Therefore the document workflow can be implemented to update the user s contacts with information about John Doe merely by providing the business card to the network connected device and activating the document workflow from the network connected device without having to manually enter any of the information about John Doe in the networking website via a network browser. Upon implementing the document workflow the user can subsequently log in to the networking website and access the information about the contact John Doe using the network browser. The document workflow can also be implemented to concurrently provide the information content of the business card to a variety of additional service applications on the network such as additional networking websites or search engine queries and can further be programmed to provide additional actions based on the implementation of the document workflow . As an example upon providing the business card to the network connected device and implementing the document workflow the document workflow can provide the name John Doe to a search engine and can return the results as a printout on a printer e.g. the network connected device .

It is to be understood that the document workflow application in the example of is but one example of a document workflow application. As another example the document could be an invoice such that a document workflow could be implemented to automatically pay bills. As another example the document could include employer and or service provided tax forms such that the user could implement a document workflow to automatically provide tax information to an online tax preparation service. As yet another example the document could be a map or could have an address on it such that a document workflow could automatically fetch driving directions to or from the location using an online direction service or could fetch information about the location using an online almanac or travel service. As a further example the user could scan a crumpled marked up or otherwise damaged document on the network connected device and activate a document workflow to implement document cleanup and skew correction services such that the network connected device prints a clean printout of the document . As yet a further example the document could include handwritten notes such that a document workflow could have the handwritten notes transformed into typed print and provided to a website or printed back out on the network connected device . Accordingly the document workflow can be implemented to perform any of a variety of actions using the document via the service application s .

In the example of a document can be provided to the network connected device . The document includes a set of information content having a plurality of components numbered through X where X is a positive integer. The information content that can include any of a variety of forms of data that can be separate and distinct from each other such as the different components of the business card in the example of . The document can be a physical hardcopy document such that the network connected device scans the document to generate a document file. Alternatively the document can be a document file such as provided to the network connected device via the network or a separate network. Thus the document file is accessible by the network demonstrated in the example of as FILE.

Similar to as described above in the examples of a user can implement the document workflow via a user interface of the network connected device . As an example the user interface can physically reside on the network connected device or can be a software interface on a computing device such as coupled to the network connected device via a LAN or WAN. Thus the user can activate the document workflow on the network connected device via the user interface . The document workflow can be implemented to provide the components of the information content directly from the network connected device to one or more of a plurality N of service application services residing on the network where N is a positive integer. For example the service applications can include a variety of websites on the Internet that provide a service by executing one or more actions based on information provided by the user to the website.

To implement the document workflow the network includes a device API and a document processing API . The device API can be programmed as a device interface API with respect to the network connected device . As a result the document workflow can be implemented without a need for understanding or using the lower level protocols utilized by the network connected device . For example upon the document workflow being activated the device API can be configured to access a workflow container residing on the network .

In the example of the workflow container includes a set of device data associated with a given document workflow. As an example the workflow container can be configured to store sets of device data for each of a plurality of document workflows for each of a plurality of different network connected devices. Thus the device API can enable access to a document services framework that includes a plurality M of document services via the network connected device where M is a positive integer. As an example the network security API access functionality can set the document services framework as a callback to an asynchronous scan request by the network connected device . The device API can thus provide the set of device data corresponding to the specific document workflow to the network connected device to configure the network connected device with settings that may be required by the document processing API and or the one or more of document services in the document services framework .

In the example of the set of device data is provided to the network connected device via a signal CONFIG. As an example the set of device data can specify scanning requirements of the network connected device configured as a scanning device based on a simple call to the device API such as a requirement by a document service to scan the document with a predetermined minimum resolution e.g. 600 dots per inch dpi .

The device API can also implement network security functionality that can provide security features for the user to access the service applications . In the example of the workflow container includes a set of user data associated with a given document workflow. As an example the user data can be implemented as repository configured to store sets of user data for each of a plurality of users for each of a plurality of different document workflows. Each of the sets of user data can correspond to unique information associated with the specific user that implements the document workflow such including as a username and password for one or more web services. For instance a user can enter such information as part of a workflow configuration session e.g. a secure session for each service application s that is to be implemented in a given workflow. In this way the document workflow can securely access the set of user data to the respective service applications that are to be accessed for a given document workflow. Such security features can be implemented for example by leveraging a Cloud print functionality not shown and extending a payload used over an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP for signaling and using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS for secure uploading of the document file corresponding to the document .

As another example at least a portion of the device API can reside on the network connected device itself. For instance the network connected device can be configured to select the document workflow from a plurality of predetermined document workflows and automatically activate the document workflow based on contents in the document . In this example the network connected device can be programmed to recognize e.g. via optical character recognition algorithm and differentiate at least some of the information content of the document file automatically. As an example the network connected device could be programmed to automatically recognize a business card e.g. the business card in the example of such that the network connected device can automatically identify that the document is a business card such as based on the size of the document and or location of the information content therein. In response the network connected device could be configured to automatically select a business card document workflow from a list of document workflows. Thus the selected workflow can in turn employ the device API to set the appropriate scan settings of the network connected device identify relevant portions of the business card to the document processing API and or access resource locators on the network corresponding to the respective service applications corresponding to the document workflow .

The document processing API includes an interface for invoking content extraction functionality to extract the components of the information content from the document . The content extraction functionality can support one or more of the document services corresponding to a variety of image processing algorithms such as handwriting interpretation text extraction facial recognition or a variety of other algorithms that can extract the information content from the document . The document processing API can thus allow access to document services that are third party processing engines such as capable of performing optical character recognition OCR for extracting the information content . Thus the document processing API can be utilized to convert the information content to a form that is usable by the respective service applications for executing actions based on the information content . Thus the workflow via its APIs and can provide extracted components of the information content as inputs to the appropriate service applications along with requisite security data from the user data .

The document services framework can be programmed to allow a plug and play environment for a variety of document services that can implement document processing. As an example document workflow creators can develop a variety of workflow and document processing APIs such as the workflow and document processing APIs and that can work with the existing document services framework . In addition as described above the document services framework can coordinate with the device API to enable secured access between the network connected device and the service applications such as by seamlessly supporting secured authorization and authentication between the network connected device and the service applications . Furthermore the document services framework can allow a variety of additional core services to support specific service applications such as orchestration discovery deployment and or coordination.

As a result of the interaction of the workflow and document processing APIs and with the network connected device and the document services framework the document workflow can thus input the information content to the service applications in a usable manner for the service applications for executing one or more actions based on the components of the information content . As part of a given document workflow the processing API can invoke one or more of the document services to provide the extracted information content on behalf of a given user securely to one or more of the service applications .

In the example of the components of the information content of the document are demonstrated as being provided to each of the service applications as X components of content . Thus the components of the information content can be provided to one or more of the service applications as the components of content . Therefore upon implementing the document workflow the content can be available to a user such as by accessing one or more of the service applications via a network browser on the computing device . As another example the document workflow can implement one or more of the service applications via the content to implement an action using the network connected device such as printing out a result based on the content as described herein. That is a given workflow can employ the device API to retrieve content from the network connected device to send content to the network connected device to be processed thereby e.g. printed or both retrieve content from and send content which may be the same or different content back to the device for processing. In this way the network connected device can be utilized by the workflow via the API as one of the service applications in the architecture .

It is to be understood that while the example of demonstrates X components of content in each of the service applications not all of the components of the information content need be provided to each of the service applications or that the components of the information content need be provided to more than one service application . As an example some portions of the information content can be provided to one service application while other portions of the information content can be provided to other service applications .

The above described implementation of the document workflows assumes pre existing architecture resident on the network with respect to the workflow and document processing APIs and and the respective document services of the service applications . However a user may desire to implement a custom document workflow that has not yet been developed. Therefore the network includes a custom workflow generation architecture that is configured to develop document workflows that are generated based on user action such as by manually implementing the steps of the desired document workflow via the network connected device and the network browser .

The document workflow generation system includes a custom document workflow generation architecture that is configured to generate an automated document workflow such as described herein. The user can generate the custom document workflow by recording a set of manually implemented steps corresponding to the desired document workflow via user inputs. For instance the user can provide the document to the network connected device in the manner described herein i.e. by scanning or streaming to generate the document file. The document file can then be provided to the computing device via the signal FILE such that the user can manually provide the document file to the respective service application manually via the network browser . As an example the user can upload the document file to the service application or can manually enter the information content of the document directly to the service application . It is thus to be understood that in manually implementing the steps of the desired document workflow the generation of the document file corresponding to the document may be unnecessary.

Prior to performing the manual steps of the desired document workflow the user can initiate a browser action recorder service of the workflow generation architecture on the network demonstrated in the example of as being performed via an enable signal EN. The browser action recorder can thus record the manual steps performed by the user in implementing the desired document workflow on the network browser . Thus the network interactions performed via the user inputs can be recorded such as the resource locator s of the service application and the manner and format in which the user inputs the information content into the service application . The browser action recorder can thus capture the semantics of the manual steps provided by the user to analyze them and generate a workflow template script WTS .

The WTS can be provided to a document workflow repository resident on the network . The document workflow repository can be configured as a storage with which the WTS can be registered with and stored in a repository on the network. Thus the document workflow repository can generate a resource locator such as a Uniform Resource Locator URL . The resource locator can thus be provided to a document workflow execution engine on the network that can be accessible via the unique resource locator for subsequent execution of the document workflow. For example to subsequently implement the document workflow in the automated manner described herein the user e.g. via a device or application can access the document workflow execution engine via the unique resource locator such as using the network connected device to access the registered WTS. Thus the document workflow execution engine can execute the document workflow steps that are provided on the WTS for the execution of the document workflow.

As an example the document workflow execution engine can access the document services framework to access the respective service application and or necessary third party image processing services based on the steps recorded in the WTS for implementation of the document workflow. Accordingly the user can generate a custom document workflow without the need for or knowledge necessary for generating the associated workflow and document processing APIs and .

As another example the document workflow execution engine can be configured to invoke existing the document services framework and or existing APIs such as based on the user specifying the information on a given document file with which the desired document workflow can be associated. For example the user can scan a business card and using a PC or other network device can specify locations of the specific information content on the image of the business card with which the user wishes to invoke the document services framework . Thus the user can invoke an existing document processing API via a PC either manually or automatically which implements the document services framework to update a contact list on a networking website such as similar to the example of based on specifying the location of the information content on the business card. One or more of the steps to implement the desired document workflow including specifying the location of the information content can be recorded by the browser action recorder such that the document workflow can be created by the custom workflow generation architecture . Accordingly custom workflows can be generated without the need for programming by a user.

In view of the foregoing structural and functional features described above an example method will be better appreciated with reference to . While for purposes of simplicity of explanation the method of is shown and described as executing serially it is to be understood and appreciated that the method is not limited by the illustrated order as parts of the method could occur in different orders and or concurrently from that shown and described herein.

What have been described above are examples. It is of course not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many further combinations and permutations are possible. Accordingly the invention is intended to embrace all such alterations modifications and variations that fall within the scope of this application including the appended claims. Additionally where the disclosure or claims recite a an a first or another element or the equivalent thereof it should be interpreted to include one or more than one such element neither requiring nor excluding two or more such elements.
