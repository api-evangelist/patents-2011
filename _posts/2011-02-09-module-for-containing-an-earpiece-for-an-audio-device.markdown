The present disclosure relates to modules for containing earpieces when installed in an audio device such as a mobile device.

Ear speakers used in audio devices such as mobile telephones and headphones also known as earpieces often utilize a protruding spring like contact to both create an electrical connection between the earpiece and an audio signal source and to physically hold the earpiece in place within a housing of the audio device. In many instances the spring force exerted by this contact is borne by the housing of the audio device itself resulting in physical stress and strain on the housing.

In many audio devices the stress and strain exerted on the housing by the spring like contact causes deformation of the housing that is visible from the outside of the audio device. In some instances the stress and strain exerted by the spring like contact can cause physical damage and breakage of the housing.

Reference is now made to which illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a mobile electronic device one example of an audio device with which an earpiece module or a module for containing an earpiece can be used. The mobile electronic device is a two way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities and the capability to communicate with other computer systems for example via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile electronic device in various embodiments the device may be a multiple mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication a smartphone a mobile telephone or a PDA personal digital assistant enabled for wireless communication or a computer system with a wireless modem.

The mobile electronic device includes a rigid case see housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The mobile electronic device includes a controller comprising at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem sometimes referred to as a radio layer for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen such as a liquid crystal display LCD screen input devices such as a keyboard and control buttons flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems data port such as serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port an earpiece for providing audio to the user microphone short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions.

The device may comprise a touchscreen display in some embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch sensitive input device and the processor interacts with the touch sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.

The communication subsystem includes a receiver a transmitter and associated components such as one or more antenna elements and local oscillators LOs and a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP . The antenna elements and may be embedded or internal to the mobile electronic device and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem depends on the wireless network in which mobile electronic device is intended to operate.

The mobile electronic device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The mobile electronic device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are output to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules comprise operating system software software applications comprising an email messaging application also referred to as an email client a personal address book a calendar application and a phone application for non limiting example.

The software applications also may include a range of applications including for example a notepad application Internet browser application voice communication i.e. telephony application mapping application or a media player application or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements e.g. text fields input fields icons etc. in the user interface i.e. the display screen according to the application. Where the mobile device embodies an administrator computing device a guest computing device or both an application such as a verified application containing instructions respectively associated with the administrator computing device and the guest computing device may also be included in the software applications the software modules or in other memory locations on the mobile device or in any combination thereof.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

In some embodiments the auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The mobile electronic device may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network or a GPS Global Positioning System subsystem comprising a GPS receiver or transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network not shown . The auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise a pointing or navigational input device such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

In some embodiments the mobile electronic device also includes a removable memory card or module typically comprising flash memory and a memory card interface . Network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile electronic device via the memory card which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface of the mobile electronic device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .

The mobile electronic device also stores other data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments the data includes service data comprising information required by the mobile electronic device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile electronic device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the mobile electronic device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.

The mobile electronic device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile electronic device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile electronic device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile electronic device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile electronic device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile electronic device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the serial port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile electronic device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile electronic device .

The mobile electronic device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile electronic device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile electronic device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals are output to the earpiece and signals for transmission are generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the phone application and hardware i.e. the microphone the earpiece and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the earpiece the display screen may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The phone application can be split into multiple applications or sub modules for example one or more user phone modules and a call control module. The user phone modules provide a variety of telephony features through a user interface while the call control module provides access to common telephony functions desired by the user phone modules such that telephony requests from phone modules can be coordinated and so that the user phone modules do not need to each provide instructions understood by the wireless communications subsystem . The call control function typically makes telephony features available to user phone modules through an application programming interface API . It is to be recognized that all or part of the phone application features or functions could be provided through the operating system or otherwise distributed in the device while continuing to fall within the term phone application .

Reference is next made to which shows an example of an exemplary earpiece that is used in audio devices. The earpiece comprises a sound emitting portion and protruding spring like contacts and . The contacts and provide an electrical connection between the sound emitting portion and a source of an audio signal. The audio signal can be provided for example by the microprocessor of a mobile device or alternatively by other components of the mobile device capable of providing an audio signal for example a dedicated audio processor not shown .

The contacts and exert a spring force extending perpendicularly out of the plane formed by the sound emitting portion . This spring force serves two primary functions. The first is to ensure that electrical contact is maintained with the audio signal source that is to be rendered by the earpiece such as for example an audio signal output of a digital signal processor DSP component of the microprocessor . The second primary function of the spring force is to ensure that the earpiece remains firmly in its designated position within the audio device.

The earpiece is referred to throughout in describing embodiments of earpiece modules. However it is to be understood that other configurations of earpieces can be accommodated by the earpiece module disclosed.

Reference is next made to which shows one possible embodiment of a module for containing an earpiece for an audio device the earpiece having at least one protruding electrical contact . The module comprises a first portion and a second portion the first portion and the second portion being opposable and forming a cavity sized to accommodate an earpiece . The module further comprises at least one electrical contact within the cavity on one of the first portion and the second portion . The electrical contact is positioned to engage a protruding electrical contact of an earpiece positioned within the cavity.

Reference is next made to which shows an example embodiment of an earpiece module assembled. The earpiece module comprises a housing which has a first portion and a second portion . The housing and its portions may be made of any material suitable for bearing the spring force exerted by the contacts of an earpiece for an audio device . In an embodiment described herein the housing and its portions are made of a plastic material such as polycarbonate or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene commonly known as ABS . However other materials for example metals such as stainless steel or magnesium may be used.

In this embodiment the first portion has a first surface and the second portion has a second surface . The first surface is configured to contact a protruding electrical contact of the earpiece when positioned in the cavity. The first portion and the second portion can be movable into an opposing engagement in a variety of different ways which will be discussed in further detail below. Once the first portion and the second portion have been moved into such an opposing engagement the opposable surfaces are facing one another in a manner that contains any force exerted by the protruding electrical contact of the earpiece within the module. This helps prevent the earpiece from being pushed against a housing of an audio device in which the module is installed.

In this embodiment at least one of the portions will have a recess formed therein. The at least one recess if included is located on one or both of the first portion and the second portion such that when the first portion and the second portion are moved into opposing engagement a cavity is formed not shown in this figure that is sized to accommodate an earpiece for an audio device. A variety of different recess configurations will achieve this goal. In an example embodiment described in further detail below one portion has a recess formed therein that by itself is sized to accommodate the earpiece . Many other configurations are also possible for example one in which a recess is formed in each of the first portion and the second portion where each such recess is one half the size of the earpiece .

When one example embodiment of the earpiece module is fully assembled the earpiece is essentially contained within or sandwiched between the first portion and the second portion of the housing as shown in . The earpiece is positioned in the cavity formed between first portion and the second portion . The earpiece need not be completely enclosed by the first portion and the second portion . This can be seen from in that an upper surface of the earpiece is visible. However the contacts should be engaged by either the first portion or the second portion or both not shown in .

When the earpiece is sandwiched between the first portion and the second portion as shown in and the contacts of the earpiece are engaged by the first portion and the second portion the spring force exerted by the contacts is borne by the first portion and the second portion and is contained within the earpiece module . When the fully assembled earpiece module is placed within an audio device for example the spring force exerted by the contacts on any structure external to the earpiece module including the housing of the audio device is minimized.

Additional embodiments of the earpiece module are possible. For example depicts a module that can slide over the top portion of an earpiece and engage the contact of the earpiece . As another example depicts a module that slides over the top portion of an earpiece and engages the contact located on the side of the earpiece i.e. not on the same surface on which the sound emitting portion is located . In both of the embodiments referenced above the first portion and the second portion are in an opposing arrangement but need not be engaged in the sense that they are in physical contact as shown in . The spring force exerted by the contact is borne by the first portion and the equal opposite force is borne by the second portion . Both forces are contained within the earpiece module .

Optionally in any of the embodiments described herein either the first portion or the second portion can have an audio aperture formed therein. The audio aperture can allow for improved audio volume and quality when the sound emitting portion of the earpiece is placed adjacent to the audio aperture when the earpiece module is fully assembled.

Reference is next made to which shows another example embodiment of the earpiece module of the present disclosure. In this example embodiment the first portion and the second portion of the housing comprise a pair of brackets . The brackets can be made of any material that is suitable for the housing and its portions . The first of the pair of brackets has a first surface and the second of the pair of brackets has a second surface . In the example embodiment illustrated in the first surface has a recess formed therein. This recess is sized to accommodate the earpiece for an audio device . As discussed above the recess can appear in many configurations in conjunction with an additional recess on the second surface other opposing recess not shown so long as the cavity formed between the first and second brackets when these brackets are moved into opposing engagement is appropriately sized to accommodate an earpiece . The earpiece can be any suitable earpiece for the audio device.

The embodiment illustrated in demonstrates one possible means by which the first portion and the second portion may be moved into opposing engagement. In this embodiment the first portion and the second portion comprise two separate brackets that can be placed together in opposing engagement. Other means by which the first portion and the second portion may be brought into opposing engagement are possible such as a clam shell structure shown in by which the first portion and the second portion are hinged together at one end and can pivot around the hinge. As well it is possible that the first portion and the second portion can be made of a heat shrink material such that when heat is applied to the first portion and the second portion the portions shrink and the first surface and the second surface meet in opposing engagement.

Reference is next made to which shows another example embodiment of the earpiece module of the present disclosure. The first surface and the second surface of the first portion and the second portion illustrated in as a pair of brackets can be engaged in any suitable manner to contain the force exerted by the contacts of the earpiece within the module . In the example embodiment illustrated in heat stakes are used to achieve this engagement. Heat stakes are a well known means of attaching plastic components to one another. Heat stakes are plastic pegs that protrude from one plastic component and are sized to be inserted into corresponding plastic apertures protruding from another plastic component. Both the plastic pegs and the plastic apertures are then designed to receive heat melt at least partially and then re solidify as one piece after the heat source is removed.

In the example embodiment shown in heat stakes protrude from the first bracket . As well plastic apertures are provided on the second bracket . The apertures are positioned and sized to receive the heat stakes when the first surface and the second surface of the pair of brackets are moved into opposing engagement. Once the heat stakes have been received by the apertures heat can be applied to at least partially melt both the heat stakes and the apertures . Once the heat source has been removed the melted plastic will re solidify forming a seal that will hold the pair of brackets together.

Reference is next made to which shows another example embodiment of the earpiece module of the present disclosure. In this embodiment at least one interior contact is provided within the cavity formed between the pair of brackets when the brackets are brought into opposing engagement. The contact can be of any size and shape and be made of any material suitable for engaging at least one of contacts of an earpiece and creating an electrical connection therebetween. One contact should be provided for every contact the earpiece happens to have.

As well at least one exterior contact is provided outside the cavity formed between the pair of brackets when these brackets are brought into opposing engagement. This exterior contact can be of the same size and shape and made of the same material as the at least one interior contact . One exterior contact should be provided for each interior contact that is provided.

Furthermore a circuit is provided to establish an electrical connection between the at least one interior contact and the corresponding at least one exterior contact . The circuit should comprise distinct conductive pathways to electrically connect each pair of interior and exterior contacts .

In an embodiment illustrated in a flexible printed circuit board the flex PCB is provided. The flex PCB physically supports the interior contacts the exterior contacts and the circuit . As shown in the flex PCB can be sandwiched between the pair of brackets along with the earpiece . In this configuration the interior contacts can electrically engage the contacts of the earpiece . As well the flex PCB can extend in between engaged heat stakes and apertures carrying the circuit outside of the cavity formed between the pair of brackets and onward to the exterior contacts . This configuration allows for an audio signal to be provided to the earpiece while it is enclosed within the earpiece module .

Many other configurations that allow for an audio signal to be provided to the earpiece while enclosed within the earpiece module are possible. For example a simple insulated wire can be provided. Stripped ends of the insulated wire can comprise the interior and exterior contacts respectively with the remaining length of the wire comprising the circuit . The wire can be passed between the engaged heat stakes and apertures allowing for an audio signal to be provided to the earpiece while it is enclosed within the earpiece module . As another example an elongate metal contact can be inserted into the cavity such that one end of the contact extends between the engaged heat stakes and apertures allowing electrical contact to be made between the earpiece and a source of an audio signal external to the cavity via the elongate contact.

In the embodiment illustrated in or any other embodiment with which an audio signal from outside the earpiece module can be provided to an earpiece enclosed within the earpiece module pre assembled earpiece modules can be quickly and easily incorporated into audio devices such as mobile devices by connecting the exterior contacts to the source of the device s audio signal and positioning the pre assembled module in the audio device s housing. Assembling audio devices in this manner may decrease the time and labour required to assemble such devices which may result in lowered costs of production.

Reference is next made to which shows another example embodiment of the earpiece module of the present disclosure. Several additional components can be added to the sandwich that is the earpiece module to improve the quality of the sound emitted by the earpiece enclosed therein. For example an earpiece adhesive and earpiece gasket can be used to provide a seal so that a direct audio path exists between the sound emitting portion of the earpiece and the audio aperture . Such an arrangement provides improved sound volume and quality. As well an earpiece mesh can be attached to the bracket in which the audio aperture is formed using adhesive or any other suitable attachment means on the side opposite the side on which the sound emitting portion is adhered. The mesh filters out background noise to provide clearer audio to the user of the audio device.

Numerous other components that are either necessary or desirable in an audio device can also be physically supported by the earpiece module . For example in some mobile devices an antenna for communication with the Global Positioning System GPS is included. Other embodiments include indicator lights to aid the user. Such indicator lights are often generated by a light source internal to the mobile device and are displayed to the user via a component known as a light guide that transmits light from the internal source to the external surface of the device through internal reflection. Both of these components as well as others that may be needed or desired in an audio device can be physically supported by the earpiece module as shown in .

It should be noted that embodiments of the earpiece module described above can be equally useful with the earpiece included. That is a pre assembled earpiece module with an earpiece included can be provided. Such a module can be utilized using essentially the teachings described above modified as necessary to include the earpiece .

The earpiece module can be installed in an audio device such as a mobile electronic device as shown in . shows an example of an audio device into which an earpiece module can be installed. The audio device comprises a housing and an audio signal processing apparatus mounted within the housing. The audio signal processing apparatus can be any device capable of processing audio data and producing an audio signal for playback with an earpiece. The processor of a mobile device is an example of a device that can serve as an audio signal processing apparatus . Other devices such as dedicated audio processors can also be used. The audio device of further comprises a module for containing an earpiece as described in any of the embodiments described above. The module is mounted within the housing . The audio device of further comprises an earpiece provided in the cavity of the module the earpiece having at least one protruding electrical contact that engages the at least one electrical contact within the cavity. The earpiece is in electrical communication with the processing apparatus to receive and audio signal from the processing apparatus.

The earpiece module can be mounted in an audio device such as a mobile electronic device using other embodiments of a mounting apparatus. For example the mounting apparatus provided on the earpiece module can comprise heat stakes designed to be received by apertures provided within the housing of the mobile device . By inserting the heat stakes in the apertures and applying heat the earpiece module can be bonded to the mobile electronic device in a manner similar to that of the brackets being engaged by heat stakes and apertures . As well a heat stake can be provided in the housing of the mobile electronic device and an aperture for receiving a heat stake can be provided on the earpiece module and the earpiece module can be mounted within the mobile electronic device in essentially the same manner as described above.

The method further comprises providing an earpiece within the cavity formed between the opposable first portion and second portion . The earpiece can be any earpiece for an audio device as described above. The earpiece will have at least one protruding contact and by way of a non limiting example will have two protruding contacts . The earpiece will also have a sound emitting portion .

The method further comprises engaging the protruding electrical contact of the earpiece and the electrical contact provided within the cavity on one of the first portion and second portion . In the case that there are two protruding electrical contacts two electrical contacts should be provided within the cavity and the protruding contacts should each engage one of the electrical contacts provided within the cavity. Optionally an audio aperture can be provided in either the first or second portion . If such an audio aperture is provided the earpiece can be positioned in the cavity such that the sound emitting portion is adjacent to the audio aperture once the earpiece is at least partially enclosed in the cavity formed between the first portion and the second portion .

Optionally the first portion and the second portion can be engaged by bringing the portions into opposing engagement by any means previously described. Optionally the first portion and the second portion can be made of a plastic material capable of being melted and re solidifying such as polycarbonate or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene commonly known as ABS .
