title: Method and apparatus for network analysis
abstract: A network analysis capability is provided herein. A network analysis capability supports proactive detection of service troubles in a network by looking at the network from the perspective of the end users. A proactive detection mechanism is provided by having end user devices (e.g., smartphones, computers, and the like) run background applications which monitor for service-impacting problems and autonomously report service-impacting problems when such problems are detected. A background application, before and/or after problems are detected, collects diagnostic information and forwards the diagnostic information to a network for analysis. A network node compiles and analyzes data collected from the end user devices, data collected from one or more network-based data collectors, and, optionally, information from one or more network support systems, to diagnose problems and dynamically respond, potentially before service is impacted.

The invention relates generally to communication networks and more specifically but not exclusively to supporting management of communication networks.

Wireless Network Service Providers WNSPs are facing a growing challenge to deliver new high speed data services to end users e.g. end users using smart phones and other types of wireless devices with high service quality while minimizing operations costs. Within the context of this challenge smartphones are putting a much greater demand on the wireless data network than traditional mobile phones. This increase in demand for real time high speed data usage is frequently outpacing the ability of WNSPs to upgrade monitor and maintain the wireless data network. As a result WNSPs utilize problem detection tools and operations methods in order to try to identify and resolve service impacting troubles in the network in a manner that meets the challenge.

Various deficiencies in the prior art are addressed by embodiments for providing a network analysis capability.

In one embodiment an apparatus for controlling collection of data from a network includes a processor configured to receive from a wireless user device configured to communicate via a network path of the network feedback information indicative of detection of an event by the wireless user device wherein the feedback information comprises location information indicative of a geographic location of the wireless user device when the event is detected identify based at least in part on the location information a network element of the network path that is configured for collecting data related to the event and generate a message adapted for requesting collected data from the identified network element.

In one embodiment a method for controlling collection of data from a network includes receiving at a network node from a wireless user device configured to communicate via a network path of the network feedback information indicative of detection of an event by the wireless user device wherein the feedback information comprises location information indicative of a geographic location of the wireless user device when the event is detected identifying based at least in part on the location information a network element of the network path that is configured for collecting data related to the event and generating a message adapted for requesting collected data from the identified network element.

To facilitate understanding identical reference numerals have been used where possible to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.

In general a network analysis capability for use with a wireless network is depicted and described herein although it is noted that various other capabilities also may be presented herein.

In at least some embodiments the network analysis capability supports proactive detection of service troubles in a network by looking at the network from the perspective of the end users. In at least one embodiment proactive detection is provided by having end user devices e.g. smartphones and other devices run background applications which monitor for service impacting problems and autonomously report service impacting problems when such problems are detected. The background applications before and or after problems are detected collect diagnostic information and forward the diagnostic information to a network node for analysis. The network node compiles and analyzes data collected from the end user devices data collected from one or more network based data collectors and optionally information from one or more network support systems to diagnose problems and dynamically respond potentially before service is even impacted. In this manner wireless operators are able to provide their customers with improved quality of experience and reliability.

In at least some embodiments the network analysis capability provides a coordinated activity management mechanism that is configured to anticipate data collection needs of network operation technicians while the network operation technicians are performing management functions for the wireless network e.g. data needed in the course of troubleshooting a problem data needed in the course of correcting a problem and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

The LTE network supports communications between the UEs and ING which provides access to one or more associated IP networks . Although omitted for purposes of clarity it is noted that various non LTE access networks may interface with LTE network for enabling UEs UDs associated with non LTE access networks to utilize the LTE network to access IP networks via ING .

The LTE network is an exemplary LTE network. The configuration and operation of LTE networks will be understood by one skilled in the art. However for purposes of completeness a description of general features of LTE networks is provided herein within the context of exemplary wireless communication system .

The LTE network includes an eNodeB a Serving Gateway SGW a Packet Data Network PDN Gateway PGW a router a Mobility Management Entity MMEs a Home Subscriber Server HSS and an Authentication Authorization Accounting AAA Server . The eNodeB provides a radio access interface for UEs . The SGW PGW router MME HSS and AAA Server and optionally other components which have been omitted for purposes of clarity cooperate to provide an Evolved Packet Core EPC supporting end to end service delivery using IP. The MME HSS and AAA Server may cooperate to provide a Service Core within the EPC of LTE network .

The eNodeB supports communications for UEs . For example the communication between UEs and eNodeB may be supported using LTE Uu interfaces associated with each of the UEs . The eNodeB may support any functions suitable for being supported by an eNodeB such as providing an LTE air interface for the UEs performing radio resource management facilitating communications between UEs and SGW maintaining mappings between the LTE Uu interfaces and S1 u interfaces supported between the eNodeB and SGW and the like as well as combinations thereof. As depicted in eNodeB may be configured to include a DC configured to collect data in support of various functions of the network analysis capability. Although a single eNodeB is depicted it is noted that an LTE network is likely to include many eNodeBs.

The SGW support communications for eNodeB . For example the communication between SGW and eNodeB may be supported using an S1 u interface which may support per bearer user plane tunneling and inter eNodeB path switching during handover and which may use any suitable protocol e.g. the GPRS Tunneling Protocol User Place GTP U . The SGW may support any functions suitable for being supported by an SGW such as routing and forwarding user data packets e.g. facilitating communications between eNodeB and PGW maintaining mappings between the S1 u interfaces and S5 S8 interfaces supported between SGW and PGW and the like functioning as a mobility anchor for UEs during inter eNodeB handovers functioning as a mobility anchor between LTE and other 3GPP technologies and the like as well as combinations thereof. As depicted in SGW may be configured to include a DC configured to collect data in support of various functions of the network analysis capability. Although a single SGW is depicted as supporting a single eNodeB it is noted that an SGW is likely to support multiple eNodeBs and further that an LTE network is likely to include more than one SGW.

The PGW supports communications for SGW . For example the communication between PGW and SGW may be supported using an S5 S8 interface. In general an S5 interface provides functions such as user plane tunneling and tunnel management for communications between PGW and SGWs SGW relocation due to UE mobility and the like. In general an S8 interface which may be a Public Land Mobile Network PLMN variant of an S5 interface provides inter PLMN interfaces providing user and control plane connectivity between the SGW in the Visitor PLMN VPLMN and the PGW in the Home PLMN HPLMN . The S5 S8 interfaces may utilize any suitable protocol e.g. the GPRS Tunneling Protocol GTP Mobile Proxy IP MPIP and the like as well as combinations thereof . The PGW facilitates communications between LTE network and the ING via an SGi interface. The PGW may support any functions suitable for being supported by an PGW such as providing packet filtering providing policy enforcement functioning as a mobility anchor between 3GPP and non 3GPP technologies and the like as well as combinations thereof. As depicted in PGW may be configured to include a DC configured to collect data in support of various functions of the network analysis capability. Although a single PGW is depicted as supporting a single SGW it is noted that a PGW is likely to support multiple SGWs and further that an LTE network may include more than one PGW.

The router may be configured to facilitate routing of traffic between elements of LTE network e.g. between PGW and AAS Server between LTE network e.g. PGW and ING between LTE network e.g. PGW and DCS between LTE network e.g. PGW and AS and the like as well as various combinations thereof. Although omitted for purposes of clarity it will be appreciated that various other routers may be deployed e.g. at the backhaul leading into the SGW at the SGW at the PGW and or in any other suitable locations for facilitating routing of traffic within LTE network .

The MME provides mobility management functions in support of mobility of UEs . The MME supports eNodeB as well as other eNodeBs which are omitted for purposes of clarity . The communication between MME and eNodeB may be supported using a S1 MME interface which provides control plane protocols for communication between the MME and the eNodeB . The S1 MME interface may use any suitable protocol or combination of protocol. For example the S1 MME interface may use the Radio Access Network Application Part eRANAP protocol while using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol SCTP for transport. The MME supports the SGW . The communication between MME and SGW may be supported using a interfaces. The MME may support any functions suitable for being supported by a MME such selecting SGWs for UEs at time of initial attachment by the UEs and at time of intra LTE handovers providing idle mode UE tracking and paging procedures bearer activation deactivation processes providing support for Non Access Stratum NAS signaling e.g. terminating NAS signaling ciphering integrity protection for NAS signaling and the like lawful interception of signaling and the like as well as combinations thereof. The MME also may communicate with HSS using an S6a interface for authenticating users.

The HSS is configured to provide functions typically supported by an HSS in an LTE network. For example HSS may maintain subscriber related information e.g. subscriber profiles associated with users of UEs perform user authentication and or authorization functions tracking and provide subscriber related information e.g. subscriber location IP address information and the like and the like. The typical use of such functions within LTE network will be understood by one skilled in the art.

The AAA Server is configured to provide functions typically supported by an AAA Server such as authentication authorization accounting and like functions. For example authentication may include authentication of the identity of entities e.g. using credentials . For example authorization may include determining whether a particular entity is authorized to perform a given activity e.g. based on various restrictions and associated rules . For example accounting may include event tracking tracking of consumption of network resources and the like. The typical use of such functions within LTE network will be understood by one skilled in the art.

The ING is configured to operate as a gateway from LTE network to one or more IP networks which are omitted for purposes of clarity . The IP networks accessible via LTE network and ING may include one or more packet data networks via which UEs may access content services and the like. For example the IP network s accessible via LTE network and ING may include a public IP network e.g. the Internet an IP Core network of the WNSP one or more other IP networks e.g. IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS networks and the like and the like as well as various combinations thereof. The access to IP networks may be provided for UEs which access LTE network via eNodeB and optionally for UEs associated with one or more non LTE networks with which LTE network may interface e.g. 3GPP access networks non 3GPP access networks and the like . As depicted in ING may be configured to include a DC configured to collect data in support of various functions of the network analysis capability.

As depicted in a number of different types of traffic may be propagated within exemplary wireless communication system . For example bearer and test traffic network control traffic DC control traffic and the like as well as various combinations thereof may be exchanged between various combinations of elements of exemplary wireless communication system .

As depicted in bearer traffic may be sent along a path between a UE and ING where the path includes eNodeB SGW PGW and router . Similarly as depicted in test traffic may be sent along a path between a UE and AS where the path includes eNodeB SGW PGW and router . The bearer and test traffic flows are marked in .

It is noted that the path along which bearer traffic flows for a given UE may be referred to herein as a network data path or more generally as a network path.

For example each UE is configured to communicate along a network data path including eNodeB SGW PGW router and ING each of which has a DC configured thereon or associated therewith. The inclusion of DCs on each of the elements along the network data path via which a UE is communicating or may communicate enables collection of data from elements along the network data path. Although primarily depicted and described with respect to a single network data path it is noted that different UEs may communicate along different network data paths e.g. where UEs access LTE network via different eNodeBs or other access devices where different SGWs support different sets of eNodeBs via which UEs access LTE network where load balancing and or other traffic control capabilities are employed and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

As depicted in network control traffic may be exchanged within the service core and between the service core and other elements not forming part of the service core. For example network control traffic may be exchanged between eNodeB and MME between MME and HSS between HSS and AAA Server and between AAA Server and PGW . It is noted that the network control traffic paths depicted in are merely exemplary and that various other combinations of network control paths may be supported. The network control traffic flows are marked in .

As depicted in DC control traffic may be exchanged between various elements of exemplary wireless communication system which may be involved in data collection according to various embodiments depicted and described herein.

In one embodiment DCS may exchange DC control traffic with any of the DCs of any of the elements of exemplary wireless communication system e.g. consumer UEs operator UEs eNodeB SGW PGW router ING AS and the like .

In one embodiment as depicted in DC control traffic is exchanged between DCS and each of the DCs with the exception of the DC associated with AS in a linear manner via router and the network data path. For example DC control traffic sent by a consumer UE and intended for DCS will traverse the path from UE to eNodeB to SGW to PGW to router to DCS . Similarly for example DC control traffic sent by SGW and intended for DCS will traverse the path from SGW to PGW to router to DCS .

It is noted that although DC control traffic is depicted as being routed between DCS and each of the DCs with the exception of the DC associated with AS in a linear manner via router and the network data path DC control traffic may be exchanged between DCS and one or more of the DCs in any other suitable manner. For example DCS and any of the DCs may exchange DC control traffic via any other suitable communication paths which may be supported between DCS and any of the DCs .

In one embodiment as depicted in DC control traffic is exchanged between DCS and AS via router . It is noted that although DC control traffic is depicted as being routed between DCS and AS via router DC control traffic may be exchanged between DCS and AS in any other suitable manner. For example DCS and AS may exchange DC control traffic via any other suitable communication paths which may be supported between DCS and AS .

In one embodiment DCS may exchange DC control traffic with SS . In one embodiment as depicted in DC control traffic is exchanged between DCS and SS via a communication path that does not traverse the LTE network .

The DC control traffic may include any types of traffic associated with supporting collection of data. For example the DC control traffic may include data collection feedback information provided from UEs to DCS data collection control information generated by DCS and propagated to one or more DCs for controlling collection of data by one or more DCs data collected by DCs and provided to DCS and or SS and the like as well as various combinations thereof. The DCs are configured to collect data to be provided to DCS and optionally one or more other systems .

The DCs may be configured to collect data in response to data collection control information received at the DCs from DCS .

The DCs may be configured to collect data independent of data collection control information received at the DCs from DCS . In this case the DCs may collect data independent of control by DCS and receipt of data collection control information from DCS triggers the DCs to provide the previously collected data to DCS .

The DCs are configured to store collected data locally. The DCs may store collected data locally using any suitable data storage mechanisms. In one embodiment DCs may storage data by buffering the data e.g. using circular buffers and or any other suitable types of buffers .

The DCs are configured to provide collected data to one or more other network elements for processing e.g. DCS SS and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

The DCs may collect any suitable types of data which may depend on the type s of network elements on which the DCs are implemented. For example at least some of the data collected on a UE eNodeB SGW PGW ING and AS may be different across these different devices. In one embodiment a DC may be configured to operate as a network IP packet monitor for collecting data along the network path e.g. collecting bearer traffic along the network path between a UE and ING .

In one embodiment DCs are configured to timestamp collected data. The timestamp information may be used locally by the DCs for responding to data requests from DCS provided to DCS along with the collected data that is time stamped and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

Although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to embodiments in which DCs passively collect data it is noted that one or more DCs may be configured to perform various functions for triggering collection of data. In one embodiment for example one or more DCs may be configured for initiating tests within exemplary wireless communication system . For example DCs associated with UEs may initiate test packets and collect the associated test results. For example the DC associated with AS may initiate test packets and collect the associated test results. It is noted that DCs may be configured for initiating various other types of activities which may facilitate local and or remote collection of data by those DCs .

Although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to embodiments in which DCs are controlled by DCS it is noted that one or more of the DCs also may be controlled by one or more other elements of exemplary wireless communication system . In one embodiment DCs available on the consumer UEs are controllable by the consumer UEs respectively. In one embodiment DCs available on the operator UEs are controllable by the operator UEs respectively. In one embodiment DCs available one or more elements of LTE network are controllable by consumer UEs and or operator UEs .

As described herein a DC may be provided on a given element of exemplary wireless communication system in any suitable manner. For example a DC may be provided on a given element of exemplary wireless communication system at any suitable time. For example a DC may be provided on a given element of exemplary wireless communication system prior to deployment of the element after deployment of the element e.g. via configuration of the element to dedicate memory for collection of data or in any other suitable manner and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

Although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to embodiments in which a DC is configured on specific elements of exemplary wireless communication system it is noted that DCs may be configured on any element or elements of exemplary wireless communication system .

Similarly although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to embodiments in which each element of exemplary wireless communication system having a DC configured thereon has only a single DC configured thereon it is noted that multiple DCs may be configured on one or more of the elements of exemplary wireless communication system . In at least some such embodiments multiple DCs of an element of exemplary wireless communication system may be dedicated for different purposes e.g. for different types of data to be collected for different servers supported by exemplary wireless communication system and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

Similarly although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to embodiments in which DCs are implemented on existing elements of the exemplary wireless communication system it is noted that in at least some embodiments at least a portion of the DCs may be provided as standalone elements e.g. in communication with existing elements of the exemplary wireless communication system disposed in communication paths between existing elements of the exemplary wireless communication system and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

The DCS is configured to provide various data collection control capabilities. The DCS is configured to receive data collection feedback information adapted for use by the DCS in configuring the collection of data by the DCs . The DCS is configured to generate on the basis of the data collection feedback information data collection control information adapted for use by the DCs in determining collection of data. The DCS is configured to propagate the data collection control information to the appropriate DCs for instructing the DCs to collect data.

The data collection feedback information may include any information suitable for use by DCS in determining the manner in which data is to be collected by DCs . The data collection feedback information may be received from any suitable source s of such information e.g. consumer UEs operator UEs elements of LTE network AS SS other network elements and or management systems not depicted and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

At step DCS sends monitoring information to the application of UE . The monitoring information defines the monitoring to be performed by application of UE . For example the monitoring information may specify that the application of UE is to monitor for various events trigger conditions and the like. The monitoring information may be specified in any suitable manner e.g. using rules thresholds and the like as well as various combinations thereof . It is noted that although primarily depicted and described with respect to an embodiment in which the application of UE receives monitoring information from the DCS the application of UE may receive monitoring information from any other suitable element e.g. AS SS or any other suitable element s .

At step application of UE performs monitoring based on the received monitoring information. For example the application of UE may monitor for purposes of detecting one or more events trigger conditions and the like. For example an event may be dropping of a call e.g. which would trigger the application to send associated call related data collected by application to DCS . For example an event may be dropping of a data session e.g. which would trigger the application to send associated session related data collected by application to DCS . For example a user of the UE may indicate e.g. via application or in any other suitable manner that his or her quality of experience is unacceptable and the application may detect such an indication as an event which would trigger the application to send collected data to DCS . It is noted that various other types of events may be defined and similarly that monitoring may be performed for detecting various other types of events e.g. crossing of thresholds detection of packet loss receipt of test packets and the like .

At step application of UE upon detection of an event based on monitoring performed based on the monitoring information sends data collection feedback information to DCS . In the data collection feedback information is provided in the form of an event reported from the application to DCS although it is noted that such data collection feedback information may be provided to DCS in any other suitable manner.

It is noted that such information may be used to define the monitoring information upon which event monitoring is based may be collected and analyzed within the context of monitoring for event detection and or may be provided as data collection feedback information reported in response to detection of an event. It is noted that such information may be collected by application on the UE extracted from UE by the application and the like. It is noted that at least some of the information may be collected prior to detection of an event by the application e.g. where such information is collected and analyzed by the application for determining whether an event is detected such that data collection feedback information is to be reported to DCS and or after detection of an event e.g. where detection of an event causes collection of such information to be provided to DCS when the event is reported to DCS .

In at least some embodiments applications of operator UEs may be configured to provide additional functions e.g. in addition to those described with respect to both consumer UEs and operator UEs related to defining of the monitoring information upon which event monitoring is based collection and analysis of data within the context of monitoring for event detection and or propagation of data collection feedback information reported in response to detection of an event. For example applications may be configured to enable the operators of the operator UEs to be able to select from list available from the applications a specific test or tests that will initiate a call or data session so that the associated data may be collected. For example applications may be configured to automatically send collected data to DCS and or to enable operators of the UEs to select to send collected data to DCS . At step DCS processes the data collection feedback information received from application of UE .

The DCS may process the data collection feedback information for determining whether or not to initiate collection of additional data related to the reported event e.g. is the event an anomaly not requiring further analysis is the event potential part of a trend or larger problem such that further analysis is or may be useful and the like .

The DCS upon deciding to initiate collection of additional data e.g. in response to the event in response to the event in combination with one or more other reported events and the like identifies data collection detail information which may be used by DCS to generate data collection control information that is propagated to other elements for controlling collection of data according to the data collection detail information.

The DCS generates data collection detail information using the data collection feedback information from UE . The data collection detail information may include any information suitable for use in generating data collection control information for controlling collection of data.

For example the data collection detail information may include identification of the element s from which data is to be collected which may be referred to as data collection elements. For example data collection elements may include DCs e.g. of one or more of eNodeB SGW PGW ING and the like application of UE AS and the like.

For example the data collection detail information may specify the type s of data to be collected e.g. control traffic bearer traffic test traffic test results and the like the time period for which data is to be collected e.g. instructing DCs to provide previously collected data to DCS instructing DCs to initiate collection of data to be provided to DCS and the like and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

For example the data collection detail information may specify information associated with one or more tests to be performed e.g. types of tests to be performed conditions under which the tests are to be performed the manner in which the tests are to be performed indications of test results expected or desired in response to the tests and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

The data collection detail information may include any other type s of information suitable for use in controlling data collection.

In one embodiment DCS determines at least a portion of the data collection detail information using the location information received as part of the data collection feedback information. In one such embodiment for example the location information may be used by DCS for determining where in the network the problem may be occurring. For example based on received location information indicative of the geographic location of UE when the event is detected DCS may identify an eNodeB via which the UE is currently or at least likely accessing the LTE network illustratively eNodeB . The DCS having identified eNodeB from the location information may then determine the likely data path for data packets of the UE e.g. a path from eNodeB to SGW to PGW and so forth . As a result the DCS has identified network elements along the data path of the UE which may have access to data which may be analyzed for troubleshooting the problem experienced by UE . The DCS may then include each of these identified network elements as part of the data collection detail information.

The DCS generates data collection control information using the data collection detail information. The data collection control information is configured for instructing the data collection element s as to the data collection detail information. The data collection control information may be provided in any suitable format e.g. as commands for instructing elements of data collection functions to be performed as information which may be processed by elements for determining data collection functions to be performed and the like as well as various combinations thereof . It is noted that the data collection control information uses at least a portion of the data collection detail information. For example data collection control information may include information such as 1 information for instructing the DC at eNodeB that it needs to provide to DCS bearer traffic collected during the previous fifteen minute period for the UE 2 information for instructing the DC at SGW that it needs to initiate collection of bearer traffic for the UE beginning in five minutes and lasting for the next thirty minutes and provide the collected bearer traffic to DCS and 3 information for instructing the AS that it needs to initiate a test communication with application and provide the test results to DCS . It is noted that data collection control information may target any suitable element s and may instruct elements to perform any suitable types of data collection functions i.e. the foregoing examples are merely a few examples of the many different types of data collection functions which may be controlled by DCS via data collection control information .

At step DCS propagates the data collection control information to the data collection elements identified by DCS as elements from which data is to be collected. In for purposes of clarity data collection control information is only indicated as being propagated to DCs of eNodeB and SGW and to application of UE although it is noted that data collection control information may be propagated from DCS to any other suitable elements e.g. DC of PGW AS and the like . In one embodiment for example DCS sends instructions to DCs of eNodeB and SGW for instructing the DCs to collect bearer traffic associated with UE . In one embodiment depicted in FIG. for example DCS sends instructions to the application of UE e.g. to instruct the application to collect data to instruct the application to initiate test streams to AS and report the results of the tests and the like as well as various combinations thereof . In one embodiment not depicted in for example DCS sends instructions to the AS e.g. to instruct AS to collect data to instruct AS to initiate test streams to application and report the results of the tests and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

At step the data collection elements receive the data collection control information process the data collection control information to determine the data to be collected and provided to DCS and send collected data to DCS . The DCS receives the collected data from the data collection elements.

At step the DCS analyzes the collected data received from the data collection elements and propagates the analysis results toward SS . The DCS also may propagate the raw collected data toward SS and or any other system for storage. The SS receives the analysis results and optionally the raw collected data .

At step network operations staff access information e.g. analysis results raw collected data and the like and perform management functions on the basis of the accessed information. As indicated in the network operations staff may access the information via a terminal in a NOC via the web on a computer via a mobile device and the like. The network operations staff may review analysis results perform additional analysis on the basis of the received analysis results and or any other suitable information and the like. The network operations staff may perform one or more management functions such as root cause analysis for determining the root cause of the event which triggered the data collection problem resolution analysis for attempting to resolve the problem event which triggered the event and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

In at least some embodiments the network analysis capability also and or alternatively may support one or more additional scenarios and associated functions associated with those scenarios. A few exemplary scenarios and associated functions are depicted and described with respect to . Although primarily depicted and described as independent scenarios having respective groups of associated functions at least some of which may be common across at least a portion of the scenarios it is noted that 1 at least some of these exemplary scenarios and associated functions may be combined with each other and or with one or more scenarios and associated functions specifically depicted and described herein and or understood as being covered and or contemplated by various embodiments depicted and described herein and or 2 various functions of the exemplary scenarios may be employed within embodiments depicted and described herein may be combined to form embodiments and the like as well as various combinations thereof.

As depicted in a user via consumer UE is using a phone or phone services via a data connection. The application monitors one or more preset events e.g. an event to watch for and detects one of the preset events on the radio communication link between the consumer UE and eNodeB . The application signals DCS with details of the detected event. The DCS monitors the number of such events and generates data collection control information for initiating data collection along the path from consumer UE eNodeB MME ING . The data collection control information is configured to cause the DCs to save previously collected data and or to begin collecting data. The DCS receives the collected data from the DCs analyzes the collected data and provides the analysis results to SS . The operator accesses SS via the laptop or any other suitable device and finds that the data required to perform additional analysis has already been collected without the operator having to initiate and control collection of such data the collected data has already been analyzed and specific issues are already available for viewing and consideration by the operator e.g. possible causes for the event possible actions which may be taken to correct the problem and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

As depicted in the operator accesses DCS via the laptop and defines system parameters e.g. Key Performance Indicators KPIs thresholds events and the like for the entire data collection system . A user via consumer UE is using a phone or phone services via a data connection. The application monitors one or more of the preset events and identifies a violation of one of the thresholds set by the operator. The application signals DCS with details of the detected threshold violation. During this time DCs along the data path have been collecting data. The DCS using intelligence in reference to the parameters configured by the operator and the data path illustratively the data path consumer UE eNodeB SGW PGW ING generates data collection control information for initiating collection of additional data along the data path. The data collection control information is configured to cause the DCs to begin collecting additional data. The DCS receives the collected data from the DCs and analyzes the collected data. The operator accesses DCS via the laptop or any other suitable device and finds that the data required to perform additional analysis has already been collected without the operator having to initiate and control collection of such data the collected data has already been analyzed and specific issues are already available for viewing and consideration by the operator e.g. possible causes for the event possible actions which may be taken to correct the problem and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

As depicted in multiple users are accessing the LTE network via associated consumer UEs . The users are using phone or phone services via data connections respectively. On each consumer UE the associated application monitors one or more preset events e.g. an event to watch for . Initially on one of the consumer UEs the application detects one of the preset events based on data connections on the radio communication link between the consumer UE and eNodeB . The application signals DCS with details of the detected event. The DCS performs processing e.g. based on one or more parameters configured on DCS for determining if the single detected event warrants further action e.g. additional analysis collection of additional data and the like . In this case it is assumed that DCS determines that the detected event is an isolated case and thus that no further action need be taken at this point. Later applications on other consumer UEs detect events and report the detected events to DCS . The DCS processes the events and determines that the events are correlated and thus that further action is warranted. The DCS uses processing logic to determine data collection detail information e.g. to identify elements from which to collect additional data to determined the types of additional information to be collected and the like . The DCS generates data collection control information for initiating data collection from the identified elements. The data collection control information is configured to cause the DCs to save previously collected data and or to begin collecting data. The DCS receives the collected data from the DCs and analyzes the collected data. The operator accesses DCS via the laptop or any other suitable device and finds that the data required to perform additional analysis has already been collected without the operator having to initiate and control collection of such data the collected data has already been analyzed and specific issues are already available for viewing and consideration by the operator e.g. possible causes for the event possible actions which may be taken to correct the problem and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

As depicted in the operator drives out to the area of a new market e.g. where multiple new eNodeBs have been deployed for purposes of providing wireless network access in that geographic area . The operator is carrying an operator UE having an associated application running thereon. The application is configured to monitor for one or more events e.g. similar to applications on consumer UEs and further is configured to enable the operator to access and control DCS . The operator may use the application to notify DCS that it should initiate data collection by elements having DCs such that the DCS can receive and monitor all data from to the operator UE . The operator may use the application to access DCS for performing various control operations e.g. for controlling parameters such as KPIs thresholds and the like as well as various combinations thereof . The DCS generates data collection control information for initiating data collection from elements of new market . The data collection control information is configured to cause the DCs to save previously collected data and or to begin collecting data. The DCS receives the collected data from the DCs and analyzes the collected data. The operator accesses DCS via application on operator UE or any other suitable device for accessing and reviewing analysis information adapting testing of the new market and the like.

As depicted in a user via consumer UE is using a phone or phone services via a data connection. The application and DCs monitor for one or more preset events. The DCS polls application and the DCs and the DCs send collected data to DCS as events are detected. The DCS analyzes received data and events for determining whether collection of additional data is necessary or desirable. For example DCS may look into buffers at the DCs for more data from one or more recent timeframes. For example DCS may determine next actions to be performed e.g. collecting additional data triggering execution of tests with the LTE network and the like . For example DCS may work via SS to read information from third party systems e.g. such as where data from a third party RF analysis call trace system is sent to DCS via SS and correlated with information received at DCS from DCs and or consumer UE The operator accesses DCS via the laptop or any other suitable device and finds that the data required to perform additional analysis has already been collected without the operator having to initiate and control collection of such data the collected data has already been analyzed and specific issues are already available for viewing and consideration by the operator e.g. possible causes for the event possible actions which may be taken to correct the problem and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

In one embodiment a network pause function may be provided in conjunction with one or more of the embodiments depicted and described herein. In one embodiment the network pause function enables a system e.g. DCS SS and the like to issue one or more commands for temporarily pausing communications on one or more UEs . The pause command sent to a UE may specify any suitable parameters. For example in the case of a temporary pause the command may specify that communications are to be paused immediately and may include a resume timer indicative of a length of time that the UE is to wait before resuming communications e.g. 10 second 30 seconds 60 seconds 5 minutes and the like . The control of pausing resumption of communications on a UE may be controlled using any other suitable parameters. The pausing of communications on a UE may be performed for various reasons e.g. to facilitate diagnosis of an event reported by the UE to facilitate diagnosis of problem or potential problem in the network to prevent the UE from consuming network resources in a manner that is or may be negatively impacting other UEs and the like as well as various combinations thereof .

At step data collection feedback information is received.
