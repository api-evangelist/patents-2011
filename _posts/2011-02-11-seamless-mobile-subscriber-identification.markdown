These and other aspects and features of the present invention will now become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon review of the following description of specific embodiments of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

It is to be expressly understood that the description and drawings are only for the purpose of illustration of certain embodiments of the invention and are an aid for understanding. They are not intended to be a definition of the limits of the invention.

Communication device includes an identification device that stores a unique device identifier. In a non limiting embodiment the identification device can be of a type that is inserted into communication device . A non limiting example of the identification device is a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card. A non limiting example of a device identifier that can be stored by the identification device includes an IMSI International Mobile Subscriber Identity . Another non limiting example of the identification device is a biometric device and the corresponding device identifier that can be stored thereon may include a fingerprint iris scan or other biometric information obtained during an enrollment session with a user of communication device . Still other possibilities exist without departing from the scope of the invention. For simplicity the remainder of the description refers to the IMSI as an exemplary device identifier but in view of the previous comments this simplification should not be construed in a limiting way.

Communication device is registered with a service provider . Specifically a service relationship is formed between the service provider and a customer i.e. an entity responsible for communication device . As part of this service relationship a customer account is maintained for the customer and the customer agrees to pay for the privilege of receiving communication services using communication device .

The communication services are delivered to communication device over an access network which is owned and or controlled by the service provider . As mentioned above the service provider maintains a customer account associated with communication device . Thus the access network can be viewed as a home access network from the perspective of the customer and or communication device . In the following description therefore the access network will be referred to as the home access network .

One of the services provided by the service provider may be to allow communication device to access a public data network such as the internet under certain conditions. Internet access is provided from the home access network via a router gateway which can also route traffic from the internet to the home access network as well as to various other resources and components under the ownership control of the service provider collectively referred to as the domain of the service provider . By gaining access to the internet communication device can access a wealth of web sites and servers. It will be noted that the Internet is not within the domain of the service provider .

By way of example using a client side application sometimes referred to as an application interface residing on communication device communication device can access an application server that is suitably configured to execute one or more server side applications. In a non limiting embodiment the application server can be implemented by a web server and therefore can include a computing apparatus with a connection to the internet and a routable IP address. In particular communications intended for the application server can be addressed to a specific URL that is translated into the IP address of the application server by a domain name server DNS in the internet . The application server includes or has access to a memory M that stores computer readable instructions which are executed by a processing unit P forming part of the application server . Subsets of these instructions can encode individual server side applications. Examples of a server side application may include a streaming television service a self serve profile management service and a location based service i.e. an application that utilizes the current location of communication device to name just a few non limiting possibilities.

In a non limiting embodiment the client side application can be pre installed on communication device and therefore may already be encoded in memory when communication device is first shipped to the customer i.e. a pre activation scenario . In another non limiting embodiment the client side application can be obtained downloaded from the service provider or from the application server or from an application repository such as itunes Store only after communication device establishes a connection to the service provider via the home access network i.e. a post activation scenario . In a non limiting embodiment the client side application can implement an internet browser such as MS Explorer Firefox etc. In another non limiting embodiment the client side application can be a customized application that is specifically designed to interact with server side applications installed on the application server .

Continuing with the description of the service provider maintains a business backend also forming part of the domain of the service provider . In particular the business backend may comprise a variety of databases servers e.g. a lightweight directory access protocol LDAP server and other equipment for maintaining a directory number DN assigned to communication device as well as data in association with the customer account. A non limiting example of a directory number is a Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number MSISDN . Other data maintained in association with the customer account can include without limitation one or more of billing address credit card number language preference current geographic location lat long service subscription parameters e.g. does the customer account indicate a subscription to a live television service etc. and a unique device identifier such as the aforementioned IMSI associated with the identification device .

In a non limiting embodiment the business backend additionally maintains a token in association with communication device . In particular the token can be a unique information element that maps to the device identifier e.g. IMSI of communication device . In an embodiment the token is selected such that it lacks information that would allow information regarding the customer to be ascertained by an entity not within the domain of the service provider. This can be achieved by selecting a token that consists of a service provider specific subscriber identifier or a random number to name a few non limiting possibilities. With the design of such a token in place interception of the token e.g. by a hacker on the internet would not constitute a damaging breach of customer privacy.

In a non limiting embodiment and as will be described further below the token can be assigned to communication device by a mobile station identifier MSI server also forming part of the domain of the service provider . The MSI server sometimes referred to as a network subscriber identification NSI server can have an internal communication link to the home access network through which it may send the token to communication device for future use by communication device when communicating with the application server this is described further below . The MSI server can also have an internal communication link to the business backend so that the business backend may be informed of the association between the token and the device identifier of communication device . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the absence of an HTTP proxy in the architecture of removes a significant source of congestion for handling requests from communication device that are destined for the MSI server .

The business backend also has an internal communication link to a business server which is also under the ownership control of the service provider and therefore is also within the domain of the service provider . The business server can have a presence on the internet by virtue of a routable IP address. In particular in order to access the business server entities on the internet can address their communications to a specific URL that is translated into the IP address of the business server by a domain name server DNS in the internet . It will be appreciated that the business server can serve as an interface to allow servers on the internet such as the application server to send queries to and receive responses from the service provider .

It should also be appreciated that the architecture of may include other components that have not been illustrated or described in order not to obscure the description of embodiments of the present invention. Generally such components may include a variety of base stations mobile switching centers routers firewalls proxy servers and so on. It is expected that those skilled in the art will know to use such components when required or desired for a practical implementation.

Consider now which together with illustrates a message flow amongst the components illustrated in that is applicable to a scenario where the client side application is specifically associated with a particular server side application e.g. it is downloaded from an application repository such as itunes Store .

In phase A communication device establishes a data connection with the home access network . During this process and in a standard fashion an entity not shown in the home access network sends an identifier e.g. a logical identifier such as an IP address to communication device based on its directory number e.g. its MSISDN . The IP address is a logical identifier that the service provider has uniquely assigned to the MSISDN of communication device . The IP address may be statically assigned or it may be dynamically assigned and then maintained. The association between the IP address and the MSISDN may be stored in the business backend or in a server such as a Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN or an Authentication Authorization and Accounting AAA server .

In phase A which can take place before during or after phase A communication device extracts the device identifier e.g. the IMSI from the identification device e.g. the SIM card . This can be done using a lower layer protocol and or operating system as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art.

In phase A which can take place before during or after phase A a user of communication device activates the client side application . This results in the transmission of a request to the MSI server wherein the request contains the IMSI extracted in phase A . Specifically the user can click on or otherwise select an icon displayed on communication device . An address of the MSI server may be pre programmed into the client side application . Accordingly upon having been activated the client side application can be configured to automatically issue a request directed to the address of the MSI server . The address of the MSI server can be an IP address or it can be a URL which is translated into an IP address by a domain name server DNS within the home access network .

Consider now which together with illustrates a message flow amongst the components illustrated in that is applicable to a scenario where the client side application is generic e.g. a web browser .

In phase B communication device establishes a data connection with the home access network . During this process and in a standard fashion an entity not shown in the home access network sends an identifier e.g. a logical identifier such as an IP address to communication device based on its directory number e.g. its MSISDN . The IP address is a logical identifier that the service provider has uniquely assigned to the MSISDN of communication device . The IP address may be statically assigned or it may be dynamically assigned and then maintained. The association between the IP address and the MSISDN may be stored in the business backend or in a server such as a Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN or an Authentication Authorization and Accounting AAA server .

In phase B which can take place before during or after phase B communication device extracts the device identifier e.g. the IMSI from the identification device e.g. the SIM card . This can be done using a lower layer protocol and or operating system as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art.

In phase B upon gaining access to the home access network communication device establishes a data connection with the application server over the internet . This can be done using the client side application implemented as a web browser. During the data connection with the application server the user of communication device requests execution of the particular server side application on the application server . For example this may be achieved by the user selecting a URL on a web page being displayed by the application server via the client side application . For illustrative purposes a non limiting example URL of the particular server side application could be http AppID.appserver.com.

In phase B the application server detects the request for execution of the particular server side application. Based on the contents and or form of the request the application server recognizes that communication device is associated with the service provider and that a token is required before it can proceed further. The application server thus automatically redirects the client side application e.g. the web browser on communication device to a predetermined address associated with the service provider for the purpose of obtaining the token. The predetermined address may be the address of the MSI server .

In phase B communication device directs its request for a token to the MSI server . The request contains the IMSI extracted in phase B .

In both scenarios A and B and referring now to both simultaneously it will be observed that communication device sends the request to the MSI server over a path entirely within the domain of the service provider . As such the request reaches the MSI server over a channel that can be kept secure and which only traverses network equipment that is within the domain of the service provider . Also it should be appreciated that the information in the request e.g. the IMSI may be encrypted using a shared secret between communication device and the MSI server .

A non limiting example of the request sent to the MSI server would be RESTful i.e. in conformance with REST representational state transfer constraints. REST is not in itself a standard but a RESTful implementation such as the World Wide Web can use standards such as HTTP URL XML PNG etc. The following illustrates a possible formulation of the request to the MSI server 

In phase the MSI server receives the request containing the potentially encrypted IMSI from communication device . The MSI server determines the IMSI potentially through decryption using knowledge of the shared secret and sends a query to the business backend on the basis of the IMSI.

In phase the business backend receives the query from the MSI server and attempts to find the token uniquely corresponding to the IMSI supplied by the MSI server . To this end the business backend consults one or more databases.

In phase assuming the sought after token can be found in its databases the business backend returns the token to the MSI server .

In phase the MSI server releases the token to communication device over the path previously established within the home access network . To the end the token can be included in an XML response. The MSI server may also release other profile information it has obtained from the business backend such as language preference account type prepaid or postpaid etc. The following illustrates a possible formulation of an XML response to the original request sent to the MSI server 

It should be appreciated that the above example is used merely for illustrative purposes and in no way limits the scope of the invention. Notwithstanding the foregoing a general property of the token is that it appears virtually meaningless to someone who intercepts it and does not know the mapping in the business backend that associates the token to a customer.

In phase communication device now issues a request directed to the application server containing the token received from the MSI server . In a non limiting embodiment the client side application can cooperate with the operating system of communication device in order to detect when the token has been received from the service provider thereby triggering the request directed to the application server .

In scenario A whereby the client side application is specifically associated with the particular server side application an address of the particular server side application may be pre programmed into the client side application . For illustrative purposes a non limiting example address of the particular server side application could be http AppID.appserver.com. Accordingly the client side application can be configured such that upon receiving the token from the MSI server it will automatically issue a request directed to the address of the server side application residing on the application server . For illustrative purposes the request could be issued to the URL http AppID.appserver.com token.

In scenario B whereby the client side application is generic e.g. a web browser the client side application can be redirected to the URL associated with the particular server side application that was originally entered by the user in phase B while also supplying the token. For illustrative purposes an example of the URL to which the web server could be directed is http AppID.appserver.com token.

The request including the token thus travels via the router gateway and over the internet towards the application server . It is noted that the token is meaningless to an eavesdropper because it is anonymous i.e. it does not contain information that would allow information regarding the customer to be ascertained by someone outside the domain of the service provider .

In phase the application server upon receipt of the request containing the token initiates an inquiry with the business server . This can be referred to as validating the token. Specifically the application server supplies the token to the business server over a link. The link can be established over the internet and can employ virtual private network VPN technology. Alternatively establishment of the link can involve accessing a web based portal of the service provider . In either case it is assumed that the application server or an entity that controls it has an agreement with the service provider whereby such inquiries are permitted. While the application server may be within the domain of the service provider this is not required. Thus the entity that controls the application server may be independent of the service provider . The identity of the service provider and or the address of the business server can be explicitly or implicitly specified in the content and or format of the request received from communication device . Thus for example the request may identify a URL where the business server may be reached.

In phase the business server receives the token and consults one or more databases in the business backend in order to identify the associated IMSI which in this case is the IMSI of the identification device inserted into communication device . Based on the IMSI the business server obtains information about communication device . The business server then formulates a response which is sent to the application server .

The type of information about communication device obtained by the business server depends on the nature of the particular server side application that is to be executed by the application server .

In one non limiting example the particular server side application may provide a streaming television service. In such a case the application server or an entity that controls it may want to ensure that it will be paid for delivering the streaming television service to communication device . Accordingly the information about communication device obtained by the business server can include an indication of whether the customer is authorized to receive the streaming television service e.g. whether the customer is subscribed to the streaming television service . If the answer is yes the response formulated by the business server and sent to the application server can be an authorization confirmation whereas if the answer is no the response formulated by the business server and sent to the application server can be an authorization denial.

In another non limiting example the particular server side application may provide a self serve profile management service. In such a case the information about communication device obtained by the business server can include various customer profile information that the user may choose to modify through further additional interaction with the business server .

In yet another non limiting example the particular server side application may provide a location based service namely a service that utilizes information about the current location of the communication device. In such a case the information about communication device obtained by the business server can include an indication of the current geographic location e.g. GPS coordinates of communication device . The response formulated by the business server and sent to the application server can include the current geographic location of communication device . It should be appreciated that in some embodiments the current geographic location of communication device may not be stored in the business backend . Rather such information may need to be obtained from another entity possibly even from communication device itself. Therefore it is within the scope of the invention for the business server to initiate a query to communication device via control plane signaling or data plane signaling in order to obtain the current geographic location of communication device directly from communication device in an on demand fashion.

Other information associated with communication device that may similarly be formulated into a response by the business server can include address information financial information demographic information digital credentials such as usernames and passwords for accessing a variety of websites to name a few non limiting possibilities. This information may be obtained from one or more databases in the business backend .

In phase the response formulated by the business server is released to the application server e.g. over the internet . If necessary the response may be sent over an encrypted channel established between the business server and the application server .

In phase and depending on the response to its inquiry as received from the service provider in phase the application server may proceed to execute the particular server side application. The particular server side application can provide a television streaming service a self serve profile management service a location based service e.g. identification of nearby restaurants etc. or any number of a wide variety of other possible services. During execution of the particular server side application the application server can record log parameters such as usage queries made and so on.

In phase termination of the particular server side application occurs. This can happen either under control of the application server or of the user of communication device . Account settlement and reconciliation may then take place.

As mentioned previously it should be appreciated that the entity that controls the application server can be independent of the service provider . As such there may be an exchange of consideration related to execution of the particular server side application by the application server and or provision of the information about communication device by the service provider . For example the application server can be contracted by the service provider to execute the particular server side application for its customers. Under this arrangement the entity responsible for the application server can charge the service provider a fee for having executed the particular server side application whereas the service provider can in turn settle with the customer such as a through an invoicing mechanism. In such an example fees incurred as a result of having used the particular server side application could be added to the amount charged by the service provider to the customer for the current billing cycle. Under another possible arrangement the service provider can charge the application server a fee for having provided it with the information about communication device and this fee can be recouped by the application server by invoicing the customer directly for use of the particular server side application or through pre payment .

Consider now which together with illustrates a message flow amongst the components illustrated in that is applicable to a scenario where the client side application is specifically associated with a particular server side application e.g. it is downloaded from an application repository such as itunes Store .

In phase A communication device establishes a data connection with the home access network . During this process and in a standard fashion an entity not shown in the home access network sends an identifier e.g. a logical identifier such as an IP address to communication device based on its directory number e.g. its MSISDN . The IP address is a logical identifier that the service provider has uniquely assigned to the MSISDN of communication device . The IP address may be statically assigned or it may be dynamically assigned and then maintained. The association between the IP address and the MSISDN may be stored in the business backend or in a server such as the GGSN AAA server .

In phase A which can take place before during or after phase A a user of communication device activates the client side application . This results in the transmission of a request to the MSI server . Specifically the user can click on or otherwise select an icon displayed on communication device . An address of the MSI server may be pre programmed into the client side application . Accordingly upon having been activated the client side application can be configured to automatically issue a request directed to the address of the MSI server . The address of the MSI server can be an IP address or it can be a URL which is translated into an IP address by a domain name server DNS within the home access network .

Consider now which together with illustrates a message flow amongst the components illustrated in that is applicable to a scenario where the client side application is generic e.g. a web browser .

In phase B communication device establishes a data connection with the home access network . During this process and in a standard fashion an entity not shown in the home access network sends an identifier e.g. a logical identifier such as an IP address to communication device based on its directory number e.g. its MSISDN .

The application server thus automatically redirects the client side application e.g. the web browser on communication device to a predetermined address associated with the service provider for the purpose of obtaining the token. The predetermined address may be the address of the MSI server .

In phase B communication device directs its request for a token to the MSI server . A non limiting example of the request is a REST representation state transfer or other form of simple internet web service.

In both scenarios A and B and referring now to both simultaneously it will be observed that communication device sends the request to the MSI server over a path entirely within the domain of the service provider . As such the request reaches the MSI server over a channel that can be kept secure and which only traverses network equipment that is within the domain of the service provider .

A non limiting example of the request sent to the MSI server would be RESTful i.e. in conformance with REST constraints. The following illustrates a possible formulation of the request to the MSI server 

In phase the MSI server receives the request from communication device . The MSI server determines the IP address of communication device . This can be obtained from a header used in formulating the request. The MSI server then sends a query to the GGSN AAA server on the basis of the IP address.

In phase the GGSN AAA server attempts to determine the MSISDN corresponding to the IP address supplied by the MSI server . Assuming the attempt is successful the GGSN AAA server returns the MSIDN which is the MSISDN of communication device to the MSI server .

In phase the MSI server queries the business backend on the basis of the MSIDN received from the GGSN AAA server .

In phase the business backend receives the query from the MSI server and attempts to determine the token uniquely corresponding to the MSISDN supplied by the MSI server . To this end the business backend consults one or more databases.

In scenario A whereby the client side application is specifically associated with the particular server side application an address of the particular server side application may be pre programmed into the client side application . For illustrative purposes a non limiting example address of the particular server side application could be http AppID.appserver.com. Accordingly the client side application can be configured such that upon receiving the token from the MSI server it will automatically issue a request directed to the address of the server side application residing on the application server and will supply the token. For illustrative purposes the request could be issued to the URL http AppID.appserver.com token.

In scenario B whereby the client side application is generic e.g. a web browser the client side application can be redirected to the URL associated with the particular server side application that was originally entered by the user in phase B while also supplying the token. For illustrative purposes an example of the URL to which the web server could be directed is http AppID.appserver.com token.

The request including the token thus travels via the router gateway and over the internet towards the application server . It is noted that the token is meaningless to an eavesdropper because it is anonymous i.e. it does not contain information that would allow information regarding the customer to be ascertained by someone outside the domain of the service provider .

Specifically the application server supplies the token to the business server over a link. The link can be established over the internet and can employ virtual private network VPN technology. Alternatively establishment of the link can involve accessing a web based portal of the service provider . The identity of the service provider and or the address of the business server can be explicitly or implicitly specified in the content and or format of the request received from communication device . Thus for example the request may identify a URL where the business server may be reached.

In phase the business server receives the token and consults one or more databases in the business backend in order to identify the associated IMSI which in this case is the IMSI of the identification device inserted into communication device . Based on the IMSI the business server obtains information about communication device . The business server then formulates a response which is sent to the application server . Non limiting examples of the types of information about communication device that may be obtained by the business server have been provided above and need not be repeated here.

In phase the response formulated by the business server is released to the application server e.g. over the internet . If necessary the response may be sent over an encrypted channel established between the business server and the application server .

In phase and depending on the response to its inquiry as received from the service provider in phase the application server may proceed to execute the particular server side application. The particular server side application can provide a television streaming service a self serve profile management service a location based service e.g. identification of nearby restaurants etc. or any number of a wide variety of other possible services. During execution of the particular server side application the application server can record log parameters such as usage queries made and so on.

In phase termination of the particular server side application occurs. This can happen either under control of the application server or of the user of communication device . Account settlement and reconciliation may then take place. Various non limiting examples have been described above with reference to and need not be repeated here.

Consider now which illustrates a message flow amongst the components illustrated in that is applicable to a scenario where the client side application is specifically associated with a particular server side application e.g. it is downloaded from an application repository such as itunes Store .

In phase A communication device establishes a data connection with the visited access network . During this process and in a standard fashion an entity not shown in the home access network sends an identifier e.g. a logical identifier such as an IP address to communication device based on its directory number e.g. its MSISDN . The IP address is a logical identifier that the third party service provider has uniquely assigned to the MSISDN of communication device . It is assumed that this data connection allows communication device to access the internet via the visited packet access network .

The IP address may be statically assigned or it may be dynamically assigned and then maintained by the third party service provider. The association between the IP address and the MSISDN is stored by the third party service provider but may remain unknown to the service provider depending on whether or not there is a roaming partnership between the service provider and the third party service provider.

In phase A which can take place before during or after phase A communication device extracts the device identifier e.g. the IMSI from the identification device e.g. the SIM card . This can be done using a lower layer protocol and or operating system as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art.

In phase A a user of communication device activates the client side application . This results in the transmission of a request to the MSI server wherein the request contains the IMSI extracted in phase A . Specifically the user can click on or otherwise select an icon displayed on communication device . An address of the MSI server may be pre programmed into the client side application . Accordingly upon having been activated the client side application can be configured to automatically issue a request directed to the address of the MSI server which it is recalled is reachable over the internet . The address of the MSI server can be an IP address or it can be a URL which is translated into an IP address by a domain name server DNS within the visited access network .

Consider now which illustrates a message flow amongst the components illustrated in that is applicable to a scenario where the client side application is generic e.g. a web browser .

In phase B communication device establishes a data connection with the visited access network . During this process and in a standard fashion an entity not shown in the home access network sends an identifier e.g. a logical identifier such as an IP address to communication device based on its directory number e.g. its MSISDN . The IP address is a logical identifier that the third party service provider has uniquely assigned to the MSISDN of communication device . It is assumed that this data connection allows communication device to access the internet via the visited packet access network .

The IP address may be statically assigned or it may be dynamically assigned and then maintained by the third party service provider. The association between the IP address and the MSISDN is stored by the third party service provider but may remain unknown to the service provider depending on whether or not there is a roaming partnership between the service provider and the third party service provider.

In phase B which can take place before during or after phase B communication device extracts the device identifier e.g. the IMSI from the identification device e.g. the SIM card . This can be done using a lower layer protocol and or operating system as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art.

In phase B upon gaining access to the visited access network communication device establishes a data connection with the application server over the internet . This can be done using the client side application implemented as a web browser. During the data connection with the application server the user of communication device requests execution of the particular server side application on the application server . For example this may be achieved by the user selecting a URL on a web page being displayed by the application server via the client side application . For illustrative purposes a non limiting example URL of the particular server side application could be http AppID.appserver.com.

In phase B the application server detects the request for execution of the particular server side application. Based on the contents and or form of the request the application server recognizes that communication device is associated with the service provider and that a token is required before it can proceed further. The application server thus automatically redirects the client side application e.g. the web browser on communication device to a predetermined address associated with the service provider for the purpose of obtaining the token. The predetermined address may be the address of the MSI server which it is recalled is reachable over the internet .

In phase B communication device directs its request for a token to the MSI server . The request contains the IMSI extracted in phase B .

In both scenarios A and B and referring now to both simultaneously although the request sent to the MSI server does not remain entirely within the domain of the service provider the information it carries e.g. the IMSI can be kept secure by encrypting it using a shared secret between communication device and the MSI server .

In phase the MSI server receives the request containing the potentially encrypted IMSI from communication device . The MSI server determines the IMSI potentially through decryption using knowledge of the shared secret and sends a query to the business backend on the basis of the IMSI.

In phase the business backend receives the query from the MSI server and attempts to find the token uniquely corresponding to the IMSI supplied by the MSI server . To this end the business backend consults one or more databases.

In phase assuming the sought after token can be found in its databases the business backend returns the token to the MSI server .

In phase the MSI server releases the token to communication device over the path previously established via the visited access network and which may traverse the internet . To the end the token can be included in an XML response. The MSI server may also release other profile information it has obtained from the business backend such as language preference account type prepaid or postpaid etc.

In phase communication device now issues a request directed to the application server containing the token received from the MSI server . In a non limiting embodiment the client side application can cooperate with the operating system of communication device in order to detect when the token has been received from the service provider thereby triggering the request directed to the application server .

In scenario A whereby the client side application is specifically associated with the particular server side application an address of the particular server side application may be pre programmed into the client side application . Accordingly the client side application can be configured such that upon receiving the token from the MSI server it will automatically issue a request directed to the address of the server side application residing on the application server . The address of the server side application can be an IP address or it can be a URL which is translated into an IP address by a domain name server DNS within the visited access network .

In scenario B whereby the client side application is generic e.g. a web browser the client side application can be redirected to the URL associated with the particular server side application that was originally entered by the user in phase B .

The request including the token thus travels via the router gateway and over the internet towards the application server . It is noted that the token is meaningless to an eavesdropper in the visited access network because it is anonymous i.e. it does not contain information that would allow information regarding the customer to be ascertained by someone outside the domain of the service provider .

In phase the application server upon receipt of the request containing the token initiates an inquiry with the business server . Specifically the application server supplies the token to the business server over a link. The link can be established over the internet and can employ virtual private network VPN technology.

The IP address may be statically assigned or it may be dynamically assigned and then maintained by the third party service provider. The association between the IP address and the MSISDN of communication device is thus controlled by the third party service provider.

In phase A the third party service provider conveys the association between the IP address of communication device and the MSISDN of communication device to the service provider by sending such association to an agreed upon entity such as for example the MSI server or the business server . This transmission occurs by virtue of the existence of a roaming partnership between the service provider and the third party service provider. Upon receipt from the third party service provider the association between the IP address of communication device and the MSISDN of communication device may be stored in the business backend or in a server such as the GGSN AAA server .

In phase A a user of communication device activates the client side application . This results in the transmission of a request to the MSI server . Specifically the user can click on or otherwise select an icon displayed on communication device . An address of the MSI server may be pre programmed into the client side application .

Phases through are identical to the correspondingly numbered phases previously described with reference to .

Consider now which illustrates a message flow amongst the components illustrated in that is applicable to a scenario where the client side application is specifically associated with a particular server side application e.g. it is downloaded from an application repository such as itunes Store .

The association between the IP address and the MSISDN of communication device is thus controlled by the third party service provider. However in the current embodiment this association is not conveyed to the service provider .

In phase A a user of communication device activates the client side application . This results in the transmission of a request to the MSI server .

In phase B communication device establishes a data connection with the visited access network .

The IP address is a logical identifier that the third party service provider has uniquely assigned to the MSISDN of communication device .

The IP address may be statically assigned or it may be dynamically assigned and then maintained by the third party service provider. The association between the IP address and the MSISDN of communication device is thus controlled by the third party service provider. However it is recalled that in the current embodiment this association is not conveyed to the service provider .

In phase B upon gaining access to the visited access network communication device establishes a data connection with the application server over the internet . This can be done using the client side application implemented as a web browser. During the data connection with the application server the user of communication device requests execution of the particular server side application on the application server . For example this may be achieved by the user selecting a URL on a web page being displayed by the application server via the client side application . For illustrative purposes a non limiting example URL of the particular server side application could be http AppID.appserver.com.

In phase B the application server detects the request for execution of the particular server side application. Based on the contents and or form of the request the application server recognizes that communication device is associated with the service provider and that a token is required before it can proceed further. The application server thus automatically redirects the client side application e.g. the web browser on communication device to a predetermined address associated with the service provider for the purpose of obtaining the token. The predetermined address may be the address of the MSI server which it is recalled is reachable over the internet .

In both scenarios A and B and referring now to both simultaneously it will be observed that the request sent to the MSI server is devoid of any token but identifies the particular server side application to be executed. By way of example AppID could be used as an identifier of the particular server side application.

In phase the MSI server determines that the received request lacks a token. Accordingly the MSI server issues a request to communication device in which the user of communication device is asked to enter the MSISDN associated with communication device .

In phase the user of communication device provides a putative MSISDN e.g. a 10 digit phone number. The user provided MSISDN is received by the MSI server . The user of communication device may be alerted to receipt of the request from the MSI server e.g. by means of a visual or audio signal .

In phase the MSI server consults one or more databases in the business backend in order to identify the customer account and the token associated with the user provided MSISDN.

In phase the MSI server interacts with the SMS messaging entity to cause issuance of an SMS message addressed to the user provided MSISDN. The SMS message may be formulated so as to resemble a URL that supplies the token to the address of the particular server side application. For illustrative purposes a non limiting example URL could be http AppID.appserver.com token. The address of the particular server side application can be obtained from a database based on AppID which was provided by the application server .

In phase the SMS message reaches communication device via the SMS gateway and the visited access network . Naturally this assumes that the user provided MSISDN is indeed the MSISDN of communication device . If it is not namely if the user provided MSISDN is that of a different communication device then the SMS message will be received by the user of such different communication device who will not expect to receive this particular SMS message and therefore may not unreasonably suspect that an error or intrusion has taken place. An SMS utility executed by communication device may issue a signal to alert the user of communication device that the SMS message has arrived. An action can be taken such as to read the received SMS message and activate its contents. That is to say the SMS utility may permit instantiation of a web browser upon recognition of a certain string of characters. For example a browser can be instantiated upon recognizing the URL http AppID.appserver.com token.

In phase the newly instantiated web browser requests a session with the URL http AppID.appserver.com token which can be located on the application server reachable over the internet . The request including the token thus travels via the router gateway and over the internet towards the application server . It is noted that the token is meaningless to an eavesdropper because it is anonymous i.e. does not contain information that would allow information regarding the customer to be ascertained by someone outside the domain of the service provider .

Phases through are identical to the correspondingly numbered phases previously described with reference to .

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that although the example of SMS has been used this is but one of many examples where the token is transmitted over a different communication link than was used to request the directory number. For example in phase the MSI server may request a customer s email address and send an email message containing the token in phase . The email message might reach the mobile device over a different path than the SMS message or any of the other previously described messages. Still other possibilities exist and are within the scope of the present invention.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in each of the above embodiments the phases leading up to a token being provided to communication device can be omitted if communication device already knows the token based on previous interaction with the MSI server .

Also those skilled in the art will appreciate that that because the token can be made specific to the service provider it is of little meaning or value to hackers and therefore the solutions described above present a lower security risk to consumers.

Also those skilled in the art will appreciate that the manner in which services are accessed by the user of communication device appears seamless or virtually seamless from the point of view of such user. In particular the user need not take the affirmative step of entering subscription credentials or other identification data to the application server when requesting a service. Instead any required authorization requests and the like are satisfied automatically with the assistance of the MSI server and the business server .

Also those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some cases the application server may be within the domain of the service provider . This would be the case with the service provider s own e commerce or self service portal which could be accessible by the communication device over the internet . In addition the application server could have a secure internal connection to the business server business backend . In this embodiment the service provider can offer true seamless self service or electronic commerce without requiring the customer to enter passwords credentials or account information. At the same time the tokens exchanged are simply numbers that have little meaning to a party that may intercept them and thus the customer s experience is kept secure.

Also those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some embodiments steps through can be omitted. Instead the information about communication device which is sought after in order to resolve the application server s inquiry can be securely downloaded to the application server in advance for multiple customers i.e. for multiple communication devices . In this way the application server may be able to check a local i.e. cached database of previously obtained subscription information authorization information and other pertinent data rather than query the business server each time such information is needed. Of course in such a scenario it is possible that the application server could be accessing outdated stale information regarding individual communication devices and therefore a mechanism could be devised whereby subscription information and other data is updated frequently or whenever it changes between the business server and the application server .

Also those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some embodiments the various servers described above may be implemented using one or more computing apparatuses that have access to a code memory not shown which stores computer readable program code instructions for operation of the one or more computing apparatuses. The computer readable program code could be stored on a medium which is fixed tangible and readable directly by the one or more computing apparatuses e.g. removable diskette CD ROM ROM fixed disk USB drive or the computer readable program code could be stored remotely but transmittable to the one or more computing apparatuses via a modem or other interface device e.g. a communications adapter connected to a network including without limitation the Internet over a transmission medium which may be either a non wireless medium e.g. optical or analog communications lines or a wireless medium e.g. microwave infrared or other transmission schemes or a combination thereof. In other embodiments the servers may be implemented using pre programmed hardware or firmware elements e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs electrically erasable programmable read only memories EEPROMs flash memory etc. or other related components.

In the examples described above the devices and elements are connected to each other as shown in the figures for the sake of simplicity. In practical applications of the present invention elements components etc. may be connected directly to each other. As well elements components etc. may be connected indirectly to each other through other elements components etc. necessary for operation of the devices or apparatus. Thus in actual configuration the devices elements and components are directly or indirectly coupled with or connected to each other.

Certain adaptations and modifications of the described embodiments can be made. Therefore the above discussed embodiments are to be considered illustrative and not restrictive. Also it should be appreciated that additional elements that may be needed for operation of certain embodiments of the present invention have not been described or illustrated as they are assumed to be within the purview of the person of ordinary skill in the art. Moreover certain embodiments of the present invention may be free of may lack and or may function without any element that is not specifically disclosed herein. It is understood that the scope of the invention is limited only by the claims appended hereto.
