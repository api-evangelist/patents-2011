To the extent appropriate a claim of priority is made to each of the above disclosed applications.

The present invention relates to a sintered object and a method for producing the same and more specifically to a sintered object which is preferably applied as a configuration member of a vacuum process device such as an etching device a sputtering device and a CVD device applied to a production process of a semiconductor a liquid crystal display or the like and has excellent resistance to corrosion against halogen based corrosive gases and plasmas thereof and has excellent thermal conductivity and excellent electrical conductivity and a method of producing the same.

Furthermore the present invention relates to a sintered object and a method of producing the same and more specifically to a sintered object which has excellent resistance to corrosion against halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof and has excellent electrical conductivity has no frequency dependency on electrical characteristics an impedance angle when applying high frequency and is preferably used in a member exposed to the halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof and the high frequency application member of a vacuum process device such as an etching device a sputtering device and a CVD device used in a production process such as a semiconductor device and a liquid crystal display and a method of producing the same.

This application claims priority to and the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2010 026817 filed on Feb. 9 2010 Japanese Patent Application No. 2010 149324 filed on Jun. 30 2010 Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 007809 filed on Jan. 18 2011 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 012861 filed on Jan. 25 2011 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

In the related art in a production line of a semiconductor device such as an IC an LSI and a VLSI for example as a member which is used in a strict condition which is exposed to halogen based corrosive gases such as chlorine and fluorine and the plasmas thereof a member and a component formed of ceramics such as an alumina has been widely used. For example as the ceramic component in the semiconductor producing device an electrostatic chuck a clamp ring a focus ring an etching electrode or the like is adopted. As a material forming the components a ceramic material having improved resistance to corrosion is suggested for example see PTL 1 and PTL 2 .

Furthermore in a process of using the halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof a member such as the etching electrode and the focus ring in which the electrical conductivity in addition to resistance to corrosion is required is used. As such a member for example a member in which carbon nanotubes are added to an insulating ceramic such as aluminum oxide or a member in which silicon carbide is added to aluminum nitride is suggested for example see PTL 3 and PTL 4 .

Thus in a case of adding the silicon carbide as the electrical conductive material silicon carbide itself does not have sufficient resistance to corrosion against the halogen based plasma and the particle shape of silicon carbide is a spherical shape. Thus in order to exhibit electrical conductivity there is a need to set the content of silicon carbide to 20 volume or more with respect to 100 volume of aluminum nitride as a base material. However when the content of silicon carbide is 20 volume or more there is a problem in that the resistance to the corrosion of a composite material formed of aluminum nitride and silicon carbide to halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof is greatly lowered.

Furthermore in a case of adding carbon nanotubes to the insulating ceramics dispersion properties of the carbon nanotubes are degraded and thus there is a problem in that the resistance to corrosion of the halogen based plasma and the electrical conductivity are lowered.

Thus in order to solve the problems mentioned above a sintered object has been suggested which contains yttrium oxide or yttrium aluminum composite oxide and fibrous carbon in which the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed in a grain boundary of yttrium oxide or yttrium aluminum composite oxide and has a aggregation diameter of the fibrous carbon of 10 m or less PTL 5 .

The sintered object can prevent a decline in resistance to corrosion and electrical conductivity under a halogen based plasma atmosphere.

Furthermore in the related art in a member of the plasma processing device used in a production line of a semiconductor device such as an IC an LSI and a VLSI a member such as a power introduction window a gas dispersion plate and a wafer holding electrode needs to be supplied with high frequency electric power from a power source in a transmission manner. Thus the members are constituted by a material behaving as an insulator to the direct current that is dielectric.

As the dielectric aluminum oxide alumina and ceramics such as a silicon carbide are used since those elements cause low pollution of the wafer and have excellent resistance to corrosion of the plasma.

Recently as the material having excellent resistance to corrosion of the fluorine based plasma yttrium oxide yttria has been considered.

Meanwhile in the etching processing in the semiconductor production process in addition to the plasma of the reactive gas a method of applying high frequency to the processing wafer as bias electric power has been generally used. In this method bias electric power is superimposed on the electric power of the plasma and the electric potential of the plasma fluctuates in a direct current manner. However since the device material is an insulating material to the direct current the electric potential fluctuation of the plasma is not alleviated and thus an electric field is generated in the processing wafer to destroy a circuit formed on the wafer and as a consequence a proportion of a product which is defective may increase.

Thus in order to suppress the electric potential fluctuation of the plasma mentioned above a plasma processing device has been suggested in which a surface section through which plasma is directly seen in a reaction chamber inner wall is covered by the dielectric an electrical conducting section is provided in a part of the dielectric covering section and a DC earth is provided in the electrical conducting section PTL 6 . As the DC earth aluminum alloy stainless steel or the like is used.

However in the sintered object in which the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed in the grain boundary mentioned above volume resistivity properties are high for example 10 cm or more. Thus in a case where the sintered objected is used under various conditions in various vacuum process devices there is a need for electrical matching properties with a member for the vacuum process device used concurrently and there is a problem in that the design is limited. Furthermore the device and the application range to which the sintered object can be applied are limited and there is a difficulty in terms of versatility.

Furthermore in the method of producing the sintered object it is impossible to obtain the sintered object having the volume resistivity properties of 10 cm or less and thus it is impossible to obtain the sintered object which has excellent resistance to corrosion of the halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof has excellent thermal conductivity has the volume resistivity properties of 10 cm or less and also has excellent electrical conductivity.

Meanwhile in the plasma processing device in which the DC earth is installed in the electrical conducting section of the related art mentioned above there is a problem in that the metal forming the DC earth such as aluminum alloy and stainless steel comes into contact with the reactive gas to generate metal ions in the device and the metal ions contaminate the wafer and increase a proportion of a product which is defective.

Furthermore in a case of using the DC earth for an extended period of time the surface of the DC earth becomes corroded whereby the electrical conductivity to the direct current is degraded and as a consequence there is a problem in that a suppression effect of the plasma electrical potential fluctuation is lowered.

Furthermore in a case where the sintered object in which the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed in the grain boundary is used in the etching processing of the semiconductor production process a method of applying high frequency to the wafer becoming the processing target through the sintered object as the bias in addition to the plasma of the reactive gas is used. However when changing the frequency of high frequency if the electrical characteristics of the sintered object that is capacitive properties resistant properties dielectric or the like fluctuate stability of the plasma may be considerably lowered.

Furthermore when the electrical matching properties with other members in the etching device are degraded for example the impedance matching is degraded there is a problem in that the design is restricted the using device and the range are limited and the versatility decreases.

Furthermore when producing the sintered object after spraying and drying the mixed slurry in which the yttrium oxide slurry is mixed with the fibrous carbon slurry there is a need to sinter the obtained granules under a pressurization of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less. However for example when there is a need to cope with a new need in which the member is increased in size accompanied by an increase in size of the etching processing device or the like an increase in size of the pressurization sintering device used in the production process of the sintered object is limited. Thus there is a problem in that it is difficult to cope with the new need.

The present invention has been made under these circumstances and an object thereof is to provide a sintered object which has excellent resistance to corrosion of the halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof has excellent thermal conductivity has excellent electrical conductivity and has no restrictions on design a wide application range excellent versatility when applied to a member used for various vacuum process device and a method of producing the same.

Furthermore another object of the present invention is to provide a high frequency transmission material which has conductivity to the direct current which requires to restrict a plasma electrical potential fluctuation and capacitive properties capable of transmitting the high frequency electric power required for the excitation of the plasma and in which the sample may not be contaminated by the metal and which has the resistance to corrosion of plasma.

Furthermore another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a sintered object which has electrical conductivity having high versatility when being used as a member for production device of the production process of the semiconductor device and the liquid crystal display or the like and particularly has excellent resistance to corrosion of the halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof when being used as the member for the plasma device has no dependence on the frequency when high frequency is applied and is able to exhibit stability of the plasma and a method of producing the same.

In addition the present inventors carefully conducted investigations in order to solve the problems mentioned above and knew that if a composite material in which fibrous carbon such as a carbon nanotubes is dispersed in yttrium oxide is used as a material transmitting the high frequency and the composite material contains fibrous carbon at 1 volume or more and 10 volume or less with respect to the total amount of the fibrous carbon and yttrium oxide the electrical conductivity to the direct current is increased the high frequency can be transmitted through the material the sample has no risk of metal contamination and the resistance to corrosion of plasma is excellent thereby leading to the completion of the present invention.

That is a high frequency transmission material of the present invention is formed of a composite material in which the fibrous carbon is dispersed in yttrium oxide and contains the fibrous carbon of 1 volume or more and 10 volume or less with respect to the total amount of the fibrous carbon and the yttrium oxide.

Furthermore the present inventors carefully conducted investigations in order to solve the problems mentioned above and knew that if the relative density of a sintered object containing yttrium oxide and fibrous carbon is 95 or more the volume resistivity value is 30 cm or more and 1000 cm or less the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed in the grain boundary of yttrium oxide and the aggregation diameter is 1 m or less a sintered object is obtained which has excellent electrical conductivity has excellent resistance to corrosion of halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof has no frequency dependency when the high frequency is applied thereto and can stabilize the plasma thereby leading to the completion of the present invention.

That is a sintered object B of the present invention contains yttrium oxide and fibrous carbon has a relative density of 95 or more has a volume resistivity value of 30 cm or more and 1000 cm or less and the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed in a grain boundary of the yttrium oxide and has an aggregation diameter of 1 m or less.

The fibrous carbon is preferably one kind or two kinds or more selected from a group consisting of single walled carbon nanotubes two walled carbon nanotubes and multi walled carbon nanotubes.

Thus when being applied to the member used in the plasma processing device since the sintered object has excellent resistance to corrosion of the plasma and in plane uniformity of plasma etching speed and the generation of particles is low the sintered object is particularly and suitably used in the etching electrode and the focus ring. Furthermore even when being applied to the member used in various vacuum process devices the restrictions on the design are few the application range is also wide and the versatility is excellent.

According to the method of producing sintered object A of the present invention the method has a mixed slurry preparing process of mixing a yttrium oxide slurry with a fibrous carbon slurry to form a mixed slurry a granule forming process by spray drying the mixed slurry to form the granules and a sintering process of sintering the granules under a pressure of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less to form a sintered object.

Furthermore according to a the high frequency transmission material of the present invention since a composite material in which fibrous carbon is dispersed in yttrium oxide is used and which contains fibrous carbon at 1 volume or more and 10 volume or less with respect to the total amount of the fibrous carbon and yttrium oxide the electrical conductivity to the direct current can be increased and the high frequency electric power required for the excitation of the plasma can be transmitted therethrough.

Furthermore since the fibrous carbon is dispersed in the yttrium oxide to form the composite material even when the composite material comes into contact with the reactive gas there is no risk of the generation of metal ions and there is also no concern that the metal ions will contaminate the sample and increase the fraction defective of the product.

Furthermore according to the sintered object B of the present invention the relative density of a sintered object containing yttrium oxide and fibrous carbon is 95 or more the volume resistivity value is 30 cm or more and 1000 cm or less the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed in the grain boundary of yttrium oxide and the aggregation diameter is 1 m or less. Thus electrical conductivity is low resistance to corrosion of halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof can be improved there is no frequency dependency when the high frequency is applied thereto and the plasma can be stabilized.

Thus when being applied to the member used in the plasma processing device resistance to corrosion of the plasma and in plane uniformity of plasma etching speed are excellent and even when being applied to the member used in various vacuum process devices the restrictions on the design are few the application range is also wide and the versatility is excellent.

According to the method of producing the sintered object B of the present invention the method has a mixed slurry preparing process of mixing a yttrium oxide slurry with a fibrous carbon slurry to form a mixed slurry a granule forming process by spray drying the mixed slurry to form the granules and a sintering process of the granule under a pressure of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less to form a sintered object. Thus it is possible to easily obtain the sintered object which has low electrical conductivity and an excellent resistance to corrosion of the halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof has no frequency dependency when the high frequency is applied thereto and is able to stabilize the plasma.

In addition embodiments mentioned below are specifically described so as to allow easier understanding of the gist of the present invention but do not limit the present invention unless otherwise specified.

A sintered object A of the present embodiment contains yttrium oxide and fibrous carbon has a relative density of 97 or more a volume resistivity value of 0.5 cm or more and 10 cm or less and the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed and an aggregation diameter thereof is 5 m or less.

In the sintered object A yttrium oxide YO particles having high resistance to corrosion of halogen based plasma constitute a matrix.

An average particle diameter of the yttrium oxide particles is preferably 0.1 m or more and 10 m or less and more preferably 0.5 m or more and 5 m or less.

Herein a reason for limiting the average particle size of yttrium oxide to 0.1 m or more and 10 m or less is as follows. When the average particle size is less than 0.1 m since a grain boundary total number of yttrium oxide in the sintered object is increased there is a need to increase an addition amount of fibrous carbon so as to reveal electrical conductivity. However when increasing the addition amount of fibrous carbon resistance to corrosion is lowered and is not preferable. Meanwhile when the average particle diameter is greater than 10 m since the addition amount of fibrous carbon is reduced the electrical conductivity is improved the grain boundary total amount of yttrium oxide in the sintered object is reduced. Thus fibrous carbon locally exists deviation is generated in the electrical conductivity in the sintered object and when being applied to the vacuum process device there is a risk of an occurrence of abnormal discharge or the like and thus this value is not preferable.

In the sintered object A the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed. Herein the expression the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed means that the fibrous carbon is randomly arranged without showing specific orientation properties and is dispersed between the yttrium oxide particles grain boundary . That is when a certain volume is taken from the sintered object A and an average value of each fibrous carbon contained in the volume in the longitudinal direction is taken the average value thereof becomes zero.

As the fibrous carbon one kind or two kinds or more selected from a group of single layer carbon nanotubes SWCNT Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes two layer carbon nanotubes DWCNT Double Walled Carbon Nanotubes and multi layer carbon nanotubes MWCNT Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes having a diameter of 30 nm or less and a length of 10 m or less are used.

The fibrous carbons are randomly present between the yttrium oxide particles the grain boundary whereby the fibrous carbons partially come into contact with each other to form a network thereby forming an route allowing electrical conduction in the grain boundary in the sintered object.

In addition the fibrous carbon does not need to necessarily exist between the yttrium oxide particles the grain boundary and there may be a grain boundary in which the fibrous carbon does not exist.

The fibrous carbon exists in the matrix formed of the yttrium oxide particle as a single body of a fibrous carbon or a compacted object in which a plurality of the fibrous carbon of the single bodies is condensed and the aggregation diameter a diameter of the aggregated object of the aggregated object is 5 m or less preferably 2 m or less.

Herein when the aggregation diameter is greater than 5 m the fibrous carbon is easily destroyed by the halogen based plasma resistance to corrosion is lowered electrical conductivity is lowered and the generation of particles is caused. Thus this value is not preferable. Particularly when being used as a member for the semiconductor producing device the portion of the aggregated object is selectively destroyed by the plasma and as a consequence a decline in resistance to corrosion a decline in electrical conductivity and occurrence of the particles are generated and is not suitable as a member for the semiconductor producing device. Furthermore the aggregated object causes the hindrance of the sintering the density of the sintered object when performing the sintering at a low pressure is not improved and a rate of decline in volume resistivity is also insufficient. Furthermore the route allowing electrical conduction is hard to be formed and in order to exhibit electrical conductivity obtained in the sintered object there is a need to increase the content amount of the fibrous carbon.

The content rate of the fibrous carbon is preferably 0.5 volume or more and 5 volume or less with respect to the total amount of the fibrous carbon and the yttrium oxide and more preferably 1 volume or more and 3 volume or more.

Herein when the content of the fibrous carbon is lower than 0.5 volume the formation of the route allowing electrical conduction is insufficient and it is impossible to exhibit the electrical conductivity required for the sintered object. Meanwhile when the content of the fibrous carbon is greater than 5 volume the fibrous carbon easily forms a large and coarse aggregated object that is greater than 10 m and resistance to corrosion is lowered.

When a relative density that is a ratio d d of a real density d to a theoretical density d is expressed by percentage the sintered object A becomes compact at 97 or more.

Furthermore the volume resistivity value of the sintered object A is 0.5 cm or more and 10 cm or less.

Herein in order that the volume resistivity value of the sintered object is less than 0.5 cm there is a need to increase the content of the fibrous carbon. However when increasing the content the fibrous carbon is easily condensed and resistance to corrosion declines thus is not preferable. Furthermore it is not economical in terms of cost. Meanwhile if the volume resistivity value is greater than 10 cm in a case of being used under various conditions in various vacuum process devices the electrical matching with a member for the vacuum process device used simultaneously is difficult and restrictions on the design are generated and thus this value is not preferable.

The sintered object A has excellent resistance to corrosion of the halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof has excellent thermal conductivity has the volume resistivity value of 10 cm or less and has excellent electrical conductivity.

In a case where the sintered object A is applied to the constitution member of the vacuum process device such as the etching device the sputtering device and the CVD device there are few restrictions on design the application range is also wide and the versatility is also excellent.

A method of producing the sintered object A of the present embodiment has a mixed slurry preparing process of mixing a yttrium oxide slurry with a fibrous carbon slurry to form a mixed slurry a granule forming process by spray drying the mixed slurry to form the granules and a sintering process of the granules under a pressure of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less to form a sintered object.

Herein in order to mix yttrium oxide with the fibrous carbon without condensing the fibrous carbon it is desirable to prepare slurry in which the fibrous carbon is singly and uniformly dispersed in a dispersion medium in advance. Herein the slurry in which yttrium oxide particles are uniformly dispersed in the dispersion medium and the slurry in which the fibrous carbon is uniformly dispersed in the dispersion medium are separately prepared in advance.

When preparing the yttrium oxide slurry the yttrium oxide particles are added to and mixed with the dispersion medium so that the content thereof is 40 mass or more and 70 mass .

Herein the reason for setting the content of the yttrium oxide particles to 40 mass or more and 70 mass or less is to prevent an increase in viscosity of the mixed slurry when mixing the yttrium oxide slurry and the fibrous carbon slurry to prepare the mixed slurry.

Furthermore when preparing the fibrous carbon slurry the fibrous carbon a solid content is added to the dispersion medium so that the content is 0.5 mass or more and 1.5 mass or less and the mixed matter including the fibrous carbon and the dispersion medium is subjected to the dispersion processing.

Herein the reason for setting the content of the fibrous carbon in the fibrous carbon slurry to 0.5 mass or more and 1.5 mass or less is as below. When the content of the fibrous carbon is greater than 1.5 mass there is a risk of a re aggregation of the fibrous carbon the viscosity of the fibrous carbon slurry is increased the deflocculation and the dispersion in the fibrous carbon aggregated object become difficult and when being mixed with the yttrium oxide slurry there is a problem in that the uniform mixed slurry cannot be obtained or the like.

In addition if the content of the fibrous carbon in the fibrous carbon slurry is 1.5 mass or less there is no particular problem. However if the content of the fibrous carbon is unnecessarily lowered an absolute amount of the fibrous carbon in the slurry is reduced and the amount of the solvent is excessive and there is a problem such as production inefficiency and a high cost. For that reason a lower limitation value of the content of the fibrous carbon is preferably 0.5 mass .

An average secondary particle diameter of the fibrous carbon of the fibrous carbon slurry is preferably 400 nm or less.

When the average secondary particle diameter of the fibrous carbon is greater than 400 nm when being mixed with the yttrium oxide slurry and being dried the fibrous carbon is condensed and the aggregated object of the fibrous carbon in the sintered object obtained by sintering later is coarse and resistance to corrosion is lowered and thus this value is not desirable.

By setting the average secondary particle diameter of the fibrous carbon in the fibrous carbon slurry to 400 nm or less when being mixed with the yttrium oxide slurry it is possible to prevent the fibrous carbon from being condensed again in the mixed slurry and during drying. As a result the fibrous carbon in the sintered object does not form the coarse condensed matter is three dimensionally dispersed in the grain boundary of yttrium oxide particle and the route allowing electrical conduction can be effectively formed.

As the dispersion medium used in the yttrium oxide slurry and the fibrous carbon slurry water and organic solvents can be used. As the organic solvent for example monovalent alcohols and derivatives thereof such as methanol ethanol 2 propanol butanol octanol monocyclic monoterpene alcohols such as terpineol carbitols such as butyl carbitol esters such as ethyl acetate butyl acetate ethyl lactate propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate butyl carbitol acetate and butyrolactone ethers such as diethyl ether ethylene glycol monomethyl ether methyl cellosolve ethylene glycol monoethyl ether ethyl cellosolve ethylene glycol monobutyl ether butyl cellosolve diethylene glycol monomethyl ether and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether ketones such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone acetylacetone and cyclohexanone aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene toluene xylene and ethylbenzene and amides such as dimethylformamide N N dimethylacetamide and N methylpyrrolidone are preferably used and one or two kinds or more of the solvents can be used.

As the dispersion agent and the binder for example polycarboxylates such as ammonium salts of polycarboxylic acid and organic polymers such as polyethylene glycol polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl pyrrolidone or the like are used.

Since a cohesive force of the fibrous carbon itself is strong as the dispersion processing there is a need to perform deflocculation by applying a mechanical force for pre dispersion. Although it is not particularly limited as the pre dispersion method a high speed homogenizer or the like is adopted.

As the subsequent dispersion processing although it is not particularly limited a disperser such as an ultrasonic homogenizer a bead mill and an ultra high pressure grinder may be used.

Next the yttrium oxide slurry and the fibrous carbon slurry are mixed with each other to form the mixed slurry.

As the mixing method although it is not particularly limited for example a method is used in which a rotation two blade type homogenizer is combined with a wet ball mill.

Next the mixed slurry is dried by a spray drying method to obtain granules including the mixed particles of the yttrium oxide particles and the fibrous carbon.

Herein by spray drying the mixed slurry in the heated air flow while maintaining the dispersion properties of the yttrium oxide particles and the fibrous carbon in the mixed slurry the mixed particles including them are rapidly dried and can be granulated.

Herein the spraying and drying conditions of the mixed slurry are suitably adjusted so that the large granules are obtained in which satisfactory characteristics are obtained in the sintering process of the subsequent stage.

For example the spray drying condition of the mixed slurry is adjusted so that the average particle diameter of the granules becomes a size of 30 m to 100 m.

Next the granules are sintered under a pressure of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less to form the sintered object A.

Herein the reason for setting the pressure during sintering to 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less is as below. When the pressure is less than 1 MPa the density of the sintered object obtained is lowered and resistance to corrosion is lowered. Furthermore the compact sintered object is not obtained and electrical conductivity is also increased the application is limited when being used as the member for the semiconductor producing device and the versatility is impaired. Meanwhile when the pressure is greater than 20 MPa there is no problem of the density and electrical conductivity of the obtained sintered object but when designing the sintering device of the large sintered object accompanied by an increase in size of the member the pressing area is limited.

As the atmosphere during sintering since there is a need to prevent the oxidation of the fibrous carbon an inactive atmosphere such as nitrogen N argon Ar is preferable.

The reason that the sintering of the granules at 1600 C. or more and 1850 C. or less is preferable is as below. If the sintering temperature is less than 1600 C. the fibrous carbon hinders the sintering of yttrium oxide and it is impossible to obtain the sintered object having a relative density of 97 or more. Meanwhile if the sintering temperature is greater than 1850 C. yttrium oxide directly reacts with the fibrous carbon to form the carbide.

Furthermore the sintering time is for example 1 to 6 hours as long as there is sufficient time to obtain the compact sintered object.

As mentioned above when sintering the granules by performing concurrently performing the pressurization of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less the density of the sintered object can be improved while suppressing the grain growth of yttrium oxide and electrical conductivity of 10 cm or less can be expressed without cutting the route allowing electrical conduction formed by the fibrous carbon.

Furthermore an embodiment for carrying out the high frequency transmission material of the present invention will be described.

The high frequency transmission material of the present embodiment is a composite material in which the fibrous carbon is dispersed in yttrium oxide. As the composite material for example the sintered object which is obtained by sintering the mixture including the fibrous carbon and yttrium oxide under the reducing atmosphere the sheet like sintered object which is obtained by sintering a sheet containing the fibrous carbon yttrium oxide and solvent under the reducing atmosphere or the like are adopted.

The composite material contains the fibrous carbon of 1 volume or more and 10 volume or less with respect to the total amount of the fibrous carbon and yttrium oxide.

In the composite material yttrium oxide YO particles particularly having resistance to corrosion with respect to the halogen based plasma constitute the matrix.

The average particle diameter of yttrium oxide particle is preferably 0.1 m or more and 10 m or less and more preferably 0.5 m or more and 5 m or less.

Herein the reason for limiting the average particle diameter of yttrium oxide particle to 0.1 m or more and 10 m or less is as below. If the average particle diameter is less than 0.1 m since the grain boundary total number of yttrium oxide in the high frequency transmission material is increased there is a need to increase the addition amount of the fibrous carbon so as to exhibit electrical conductivity in the high frequency transmission material. However when increasing the addition amount of the fibrous carbon it is difficult to express capacitance at high frequency. Furthermore resistance to corrosion is lowered electrical conductivity during use is lowered and there is a risk of generation of particles.

Meanwhile if the average particle diameter is 10 m or more electrical conductivity is expressed by an addition of small amount of the fibrous carbon. However the grain boundary total number is reduced and the fibrous carbon is localized there is a deviation of electrical conductivity in the high frequency transmission material and there is a risk of the problem such as an abnormal discharge when being used in the plasma processing device.

The content of the fibrous carbon to the total amount of the fibrous carbon and yttrium oxide is preferably 1 volume or more and 10 volume or less and more preferably 1 volume or more and 2 volume or less.

Herein when the content of the fibrous carbon is less than 1 volume the formation of the route allowing electrical conduction in the composite material is insufficient and it is impossible to express electrical conductivity required for the composite material. Meanwhile when the content of the fibrous carbon is greater than 10 volume high frequency electrical characteristics of the fibrous carbon become dominant and behavior of the inductance properties in the high frequency band of 10 MHz or more is shown. Furthermore it is easy to form the large coarse aggregated object having the fibrous carbon that is greater than 5 m and resistance to corrosion is lowered.

Furthermore when producing the high frequency transmission material by sintering it becomes a factor that inhibits the sintering.

In the composite material the fibrous carbon of a single body or a plurality of single bodies of the fibrous carbon is present in the matrix formed of yttrium oxide as the aggregated object.

Herein when a plurality of the fibrous carbon particles of the single body is condensed to form the aggregated object the aggregation diameter of the aggregated object is preferably 5 m or less and more preferably 2 m or less.

Herein if the aggregation diameter of the aggregated object in the high frequency transmission material is greater than 5 m when being used as the member for the plasma processing device the aggregated object is selectively destroyed by the plasma and resistance to corrosion is lowered. As a consequence a decline in electrical conductivity and an occurrence of particles is generated and is not suitable as the member for the plasma processing device.

Furthermore in a case where the member is produced by the ceramic process such as the sintering the fibrous carbon becomes a factor that inhibits the sintering of the member the density of the member itself is not improved during low temperature sintering and a decline in volume resistance rate is also insufficient. Furthermore it is difficult to form the route allowing electrical conduction and there is a need to increase the content of the fibrous carbon so as to express electrical conductivity required as the member.

In the composite material the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed in the matrix formed of yttrium oxide. Herein the expression the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed means that the fibrous carbon is randomly arranged without showing a specific orientation and is dispersed between the yttrium oxide particles the grain boundary . That is when a constant volume is taken from the high frequency transmission material and an average value of the fibrous carbon contained in the volume in the longitudinal direction is taken the average value becomes zero.

The fibrous carbon is randomly present between the yttrium oxide particles the grain boundary whereby the fibrous carbon particles partly come into contact with each other to form a network and thus the route allowing electrical conduction is formed in the grain boundary in the sintered object.

In addition the fibrous carbon does not need to be necessarily present between the yttrium oxide particles the grain boundary and the grain boundary may be a grain boundary in which the fibrous carbon is not present.

Although it is not particularly limited the length of the fibrous carbon is preferably 0.1 m or more and 10 m or less when considering the dispersion properties or the like and more preferably 0.5 m or more and 5 m or less.

Herein if the length of the fibrous carbon is greater than 10 m it is difficult for the fibrous carbon to be uniformly dispersed in the grain boundary of the yttrium oxide particles. In some cases the coarse condensed matter is easily formed and resistance to corrosion is also lowered. Furthermore if the inductance properties dominate capacitive properties at high frequency the impedance angle in the high frequency band of 10 MHz or more is positive a positive value or fluctuates from the positive the positive value to a negative a negative value and thus the plasma is instable and this becomes a factor of the occurrence of the abnormal discharge.

Herein the impedance angle is a phase difference between the current and the voltage in the high frequency. In the case of the positive the positive value this is inductivity that is the inductance properties. In the case of the negative the negative value this is capacity that is the capacitance properties.

The high frequency transmission material of the present embodiment is a material which has electrical conductivity in the direct current and has the impedance angle of a negative the negative value and is greatly different from a material in which the electrical conductive matter in the normal direct current has the positive the positive value impedance angle.

The reason is because the electrons have properties conflicting with each other such as particle properties and fluctuation properties and in the direct current the electrons flow and the particle properties are dominant. In this case the electrons flow due to the potential difference in the fibrous carbon and the direct current conductivity are shown. Meanwhile in the high frequency the fluctuation properties are dominant. For example when the fibrous carbon having the diameter that is extremely smaller compared to the wavelength is independently present it is considered that the high frequency does not enter the inner portion of the fibrous carbon and is transmitted therethrough. Thus in a system in which the fibrous carbon is independently dispersed direct current conductivity corresponding to the addition amount of the fibrous carbon and capacitance corresponding to the high frequency are obtained.

If the content amount is high the fibrous carbon has preferable direct current conductivity but the high frequency capacitance is lowered. Thus as the fibrous carbon the carbon nanotubes having high electrical conductivity in a small amount are preferable.

As the carbon nanotube one kind or two kinds or more selected from a group of single layer carbon nanotubes SWCNT Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes two layer carbon nanotubes DWCNT Double Walled Carbon Nanotubes and multi layer carbon nanotubes MWCNT Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes can be used suitably.

The fibrous carbon has properties of low direct current resistance value as Fe content amount becomes smaller and thus in order to sufficiently secure electrical conductivity to the direct current the content amount of Fe is preferably 5000 ppm or less.

In the high frequency transmission material of the present embodiment the volume resistivity value when the direct current voltage is applied is preferably 30 cm or less.

Herein if the volume resistivity value when applying the direct current voltage of the high frequency transmission material is applied is greater than 30 cm an alleviation of the potential fluctuation during plasma generation is insufficient and thus the electric field is generated in the inner surface of the sample to destroy a circuit or the like formed on the sample and the defective fraction of the product is increased and is not preferable.

When a relative density that is a ratio d d of a real density d to a theoretical density d is expressed by percentage the high frequency transmission material has the density of 96 or more.

The high frequency transmission material has excellent resistance to corrosion of the halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof in the high frequency has excellent thermal conductivity has the volume resistivity value of 30 cm or less and excellent electrical conductivity.

When the high frequency transmission material is applied to the constituting member of the plasma processing device such as the etching device and the sputtering device there are fewer restrictions on design the application range is wide and versatility is excellent.

As the method of producing the high frequency transmission material if the high frequency transmission material having the properties mentioned above is obtained the method is not particularly limited. However a method of preparing the mixed powder in which yttrium oxide is mixed with the fibrous carbon and then molding and sintering the mixed powder to obtain the sintered object is preferable.

As the method of preparing the mixed powder the yttrium oxide power may be directly mixed with the fibrous carbon and the yttrium oxide powder and the fibrous carbon may be mixed with each other in liquid phase and then may be dried.

Particularly in order to uniformly disperse the fibrous carbon in yttrium oxide without the coarse aggregation a method of individually preparing the yttrium oxide slurry in which yttrium oxide is dispersed in liquid phase and the fibrous carbon slurry in which the fibrous carbon is dispersed in a liquid phase mixing the yttrium oxide slurry with the fibrous carbon slurry to form the mixed slurry spray drying the mixed slurry and sintering the mixed slurry under an inert atmosphere thereby forming the sintered object is preferable.

As the atmosphere during sintering since there is a need to prevent the oxidation of the fibrous carbon an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen N and argon Ar is preferable.

The reason is as below. If the sintering temperature is less than 1600 C. the fibrous carbon inhibits the sintering of yttrium oxide and it is impossible to obtain the sintered objects having the relative density of 97 or more. Meanwhile if the sintering temperature is greater than 1850 C. yttrium oxide directly reacts with the fibrous carbon to form carbide.

Furthermore if the sintering time is sufficient to obtain the compact sintered object the sintering time is for example 1 to 6 hours.

Hereinafter an embodiment for carrying out the sintered object B and the method of producing the same will be described.

A sintered object B of the present embodiment contains yttrium oxide and fibrous carbon has a relative density of 95 or more a volume resistivity value of 30 cm or more and 1000 cm or less and the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed in the boundary of the yttrium oxide and an aggregation diameter thereof is 1 m or less.

In the sintered object B yttrium oxide YO particles having high resistance to corrosion of halogen based plasma constitute a matrix.

An average particle diameter of the yttrium oxide particles is preferably 0.1 m or more and 10 m or less and more preferably 0.5 m or more and 5 m or less.

Herein a reason for limiting the average particle size of yttrium oxide particle to 0.1 m or more and 10 m or less is as follows. If the average particle size is less than 0.1 m since a grain boundary total number of yttrium oxide in the sintered object is increased there is a need to increase an addition amount of fibrous carbon so as to impart electrical conductivity. However when increasing the addition amount of fibrous carbon resistance to corrosion is lowered and is not preferable. Meanwhile when the average particle diameter is greater than 10 m since the addition amount of fibrous carbon is reduced the electrical conductivity is improved but the grain boundary total amount of yttrium oxide in the sintered object is reduced. Thus fibrous carbon locally exists deviation is generated in the electrical conductivity in the sintered object and when being applied to the vacuum process device there is a risk of an occurrence of abnormal discharge or the like and thus this value is not preferable. Furthermore since the surface area of yttrium oxide is reduced surface energy which is driving force of the sintering is reduced and thus it is difficult to obtain the sintered object of high density.

In the sintered object B the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed in the grain boundary of the yttrium oxide. Herein the expression the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed means that the fibrous carbon is randomly arranged without showing specific orientation properties and is dispersed between the yttrium oxide particles the grain boundary . That is when a certain volume is taken from the sintered object B and an average value of each fibrous carbon contained in the volume in the longitudinal direction is taken the average value thereof becomes zero.

As the fibrous carbon one kind or two kinds or more selected from a group of single layer carbon nanotubes SWCNT Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes two layer carbon nanotubes DWCNT Double Walled Carbon Nanotubes and multi walled carbon nanotubes MWCNT Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes having a diameter of 30 nm or less and a length of 10 m or less are used.

The fibrous carbon is randomly present between the yttrium oxide particles the grain boundary whereby the fibrous carbon particles partially come into contact with each other to from a network thereby forming an route allowing electrical conduction in the grain boundary in the sintered object.

In addition the fibrous carbon does not need to necessarily exist between the yttrium oxide particles the grain boundary and there may be a grain boundary in which the fibrous carbon does not exist.

The fibrous carbon exists in the matrix formed of the yttrium oxide particle as a single body or a aggregated object in which a plurality of the fibrous carbon of the single bodies is condensed and when forming the aggregated object the aggregation diameter a diameter of the aggregated object of the aggregated object is 1 m or less preferably 0.5 m or less.

Herein if the aggregation diameter is greater than 1 m when being used as the member for the semiconductor producing device the condensed section is easily worn by the halogen based plasma resistance to corrosion is lowered electrical conductivity lowered the occurrence of the particle is generated and thus this value is not suitable as the member for the semiconductor producing device.

Furthermore the aggregated object causes the hindrance of the sintering the density of the sintered object when performing the sintering at a low pressure is not improved and a rate of decline in volume resistivity is not also sufficiently lowered and this value is not desirable.

The content rate of the fibrous carbon is preferably 0.5 volume or more and 2 volume or less with respect to the total amount of the fibrous carbon and the yttrium oxide and more preferably 1 volume or more and 1.5 volume or less.

Herein when the content of the fibrous carbon is lower than 0.5 volume the formation of the route allowing electrical conduction is insufficient and it is impossible to exhibit the electrical conductivity required for the sintered object. Meanwhile when the content of the fibrous carbon is greater than 2 volume the fibrous carbon easily forms a coarse aggregated object that is greater than 1 m and resistance to corrosion is lowered.

When a relative density that is a ratio d d of a real density d to a theoretical density d is expressed by percentage the sintered object B becomes compact of 95 or more.

Furthermore the volume resistivity value of the sintered object B is 30 cm or more and 1000 cm or less.

Herein in order that the volume resistivity value of the sintered object is less than 30 cm there is a need to increase the content of the fibrous carbon. However when increasing the content the fibrous carbon is easily condensed and resistance to corrosion declines thus is not preferable. Furthermore if the content of the fibrous carbon is high the impedance angle of the sintered object has a positive value when the high frequency is applied and the electrical characteristics are changed from capacitive to inductive. Furthermore since the impedance angle is greatly changed by the frequency when being used in the semiconductor producing device it is difficult to impart the electrical matching properties and there is trouble in versatility. Furthermore it is not economical in terms of cost. Meanwhile if the volume resistivity value is greater than 1000 cm the addition amount of the fibrous carbon is reduced and the fibrous carbon is locally present. Thus the deviation is generated in the electrical conductivity of the sintered object and the problems such as an abnormal discharge when being used in the vacuum process device arise and thus this value is not preferable.

The sintered object B has excellent resistance to corrosion of the halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof has excellent thermal conductivity has the volume resistivity value of 30 cm or more and 1000 cm or less and has excellent electrical conductivity.

In a case where the sintered object B is applied to the constitution member of the vacuum process device such as the etching device the sputtering device and the CVD device there are fewer restrictions on design the application range is also wide and the versatility is also excellent.

A method of producing the sintered object B of the present embodiment has a mixed slurry preparing process of mixing a yttrium oxide slurry with a fibrous carbon slurry to form a mixed slurry a granule forming process by spray drying the mixed slurry to form the granules and a sintering process of the granules under a pressure of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less to form a sintered object.

Herein in order to mix yttrium oxide with the fibrous carbon without condensing the fibrous carbon it is desirable to individually prepare the yttrium oxide slurry in which the yttrium oxide particles are uniformly dispersed in a dispersion medium and the fibrous carbon slurry in which the fibrous carbon is uniformly dispersed in a dispersion medium in advance and then mix the yttrium oxide slurring with the fibrous carbon slurry to form the mixed slurry.

When preparing the yttrium oxide slurry the yttrium oxide particles are added to and mixed with the dispersion medium so that the content thereof is 40 mass or more and 70 mass . In this case the dispersion agent may be added as necessary.

Herein the reason for setting the content of the yttrium oxide particles to 40 mass or more and 70 mass is to prevent an increase in viscosity of the mixed slurry when mixing the yttrium oxide slurry to the fibrous carbon slurry to prepare the mixed slurry.

Furthermore when preparing the fibrous carbon slurry the fibrous carbon a solid content is added to the dispersion medium so that the content is 0.5 mass or more and 1.5 mass or less and the mixed matter including the fibrous carbon and the dispersion medium is subjected to the dispersion processing.

Herein the reason for setting the content of the fibrous carbon in the fibrous carbon slurry to 0.5 mass or more and 1.5 mass or less is as below. When the content of the fibrous carbon is greater than 1.5 mass there is a risk of a re aggregation of the fibrous carbon the viscosity of the fibrous carbon slurry is increased the fibrous carbon slurry has high viscosity and the deflocculation and the dispersion in the fibrous carbon aggregated object are difficult and when being mixed with the yttrium oxide slurry there is a problem in that the uniformly mixed slurry cannot be obtained or the like.

In addition if the content of the fibrous carbon in the fibrous carbon slurry is 1.5 mass or less there is no particular problem. However if the content of the fibrous carbon is unnecessarily lowered an absolute amount of the fibrous carbon in the slurry is reduced and the amount of the solvent is excessive and there is a problem such as production inefficiency and a high cost. For that reason a lower limitation value of the content of the fibrous carbon is preferably 0.5 mass .

An average secondary particle diameter of the fibrous carbon in the fibrous carbon slurry is preferably 200 nm or less.

When the average secondary particle diameter of the fibrous carbon is greater than 200 nm when being mixed with the yttrium oxide slurry and being dried the fibrous carbon is condensed and the aggregated object in the sintered object obtained by sintering later is coarse and resistance to corrosion is lowered and thus this value is not desirable.

By setting the average secondary particle diameter of the fibrous carbon in the fibrous carbon slurry to 200 nm or less when being mixed with the yttrium oxide slurry it is possible to prevent the fibrous carbon from being condensed again in the mixed slurry and during drying. As a result the fibrous carbon in the sintered object does not form the coarse condensed matter is three dimensionally dispersed in the grain boundary of yttrium oxide particle and the route allowing electrical conduction can be effectively formed.

As the dispersion medium used in the yttrium oxide slurry and the fibrous carbon slurry water and organic solvents can be used. As the organic solvent for example monovalent alcohols and derivatives thereof such as methanol ethanol 2 propanol butanol octanol monocyclic monoterpene alcohols such as terpineol carbitols such as butyl carbitol esters such as ethyl acetate butyl acetate ethyl lactate propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate butyl carbitol acetate and butyrolactone ethers such as diethyl ether ethylene glycol monomethyl ether methyl cellosolve ethylene glycol monoethyl ether ethyl cellosolve ethylene glycol monobutyl ether butyl cellosolve diethylene glycol monomethyl ether and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether ketones such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone acetylacetone and cyclohexanone aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene toluene xylene and ethylbenzene and amides such as dimethylformamide N N dimethylacetamide and N methylpyrrolidone are preferably used and one or two kinds or more of the solvents can be used.

As the dispersion agent and the binder for example polycarboxylates such as polycarboxylic acid ammonium salt and organic polymers such as polyethylene glycol polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl pyrrolidone or the like are used.

Since a cohesive force of the fibrous carbon itself is strong as the dispersion processing there is a need to perform the deflocculation by applying a mechanical force as the pre dispersion. Although it is not particularly limited as the pre dispersion method a high speed homogenizer or the like is adopted.

For the dispersion processing after that although it is not particularly limited a disperser such as an ultrasonic homogenizer a bead mill and an ultra high pressure grinder is used.

Next the yttrium oxide slurry and the fibrous carbon slurry are mixed with each other to form the mixed slurry.

As the mixing method although it is not particularly limited for example a method is used in which a rotation two blade type homogenizer is combined with a wet ball mill.

Next the mixed slurry is dried by spray drying method to obtain a granules including the mixed particles of the yttrium oxide particles and the fibrous carbon.

Herein by spray drying the mixed slurry in the heated air flow while maintaining the dispersion properties of the yttrium oxide particles and the fibrous carbon in the mixed slurry the mixed particles including them are rapidly dried and can be granulated.

Herein the spray drying condition of the mixed slurry is suitably adjusted so that the large granules are obtained in which satisfactory characteristics are obtained in the sintering process of the subsequent stage.

For example the spraying and drying conditions of the mixed slurry are adjusted so that the average particle diameter of the granules becomes the size of 30 m to 100 m.

Next the granules are sintered under pressure of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less to form the sintered object B.

Herein the reason for setting the pressure during sintering to 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less is as below. When the pressure is less than 1 MPa the density of the sintered object obtained is lowered and resistance to corrosion is lowered. Furthermore the compact sintered object is not obtained and electrical conductivity is also increased the application is limited when being used as the member for the semiconductor producing device and the versatility is impaired. This is considered due to the fact that the sintering of yttrium oxide proceeds a part thereof is condensed due to the rearrangement of the fibrous carbon and the three dimensional arrangement is lost.

Meanwhile when the pressure is greater than 20 MPa there is no problem of the density and electrical conductivity of the obtained sintered object but when designing the sintering device of the large sintered object accompanied by an increase in size of the member the pressing area is limited.

As the atmosphere during sintering since there is a need to prevent the oxidation of the fibrous carbon an inactive atmosphere such as nitrogen N argon Ar is preferable.

The reason that the sintering of the granules at 1600 C. or more and 1850 C. or less is preferable is as below. If the sintering temperature is less than 1600 C. the fibrous carbon hinders the sintering of yttrium oxide and it is impossible to obtain the sintered object having a relative density of 95 or more. Meanwhile if the sintering temperature is greater than 1850 C. yttrium oxide directly reacts with the fibrous carbon to form the carbide.

Furthermore the sintering time is for example 1 to 6 hours if there is a time enough to obtain the compact sintered object.

As mentioned above when sintering the granules by performing concurrently performing the pressurization of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less the density of the sintered object can be improved while suppressing the grain growth of yttrium oxide and electrical conductivity having volume resistivity value of 30 cm or more and 1000 cm or less can be expressed without cutting the route allowing electrical conduction formed by the fibrous carbon.

In the sintered object B thus obtained in the frequency band of 10 MHz to 1 GHz the impedance angle showing the electric characteristics of the material is always in the range of 70 to 90 . The range shows high capacitive properties and is the same characteristics as those of the insulating ceramic member for example yttrium oxide single body. That is the member is a conductive member and shows capacitive properties when applying the high frequency. Furthermore since the content amount of the fibrous carbon is minute substantially the same resistance to corrosion as that of yttrium oxide single body is exhibited. Thus as the member for the semiconductor producing device the substitution for the current insulating member in which the electrical conductivity is required and an application to the member to which the high frequency is applied are exhibited.

According to the sintered object B of the present embodiment the relative density of the sintered object containing yttrium oxide and fibrous carbon is 95 or more the volume resistivity value is 30 cm or more and 1000 cm or less the fibrous carbon is three dimensionally dispersed in the grain boundary of yttrium oxide and the aggregation diameter is 1 m or less. Thus electrical conductivity is low resistance to corrosion of halogen based corrosive gases and the plasmas thereof can be improved there is no frequency dependency when the high frequency is applied thereto and the plasma can be stabilized.

According to the method of producing the sintered object B of the present embodiment since the average secondary particle diameter in the fibrous carbon slurry is 200 nm or less and the content of the fibrous carbon is 0.5 mass or more and 1.5 mass or less when the fibrous carbon slurry is mixed with the yttrium oxide slurry it is possible to suppress that the fibrous carbon is condensed in the mixed slurry and during drying again. As a consequence the fibrous carbon in the sintered object does not form the coarse condensed matter of 1 m or more but is three dimensionally dispersed in the yttrium oxide grain boundary whereby the route allowing electrical conduction can be effectively formed.

Furthermore by concurrently performing the pressurization of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less during sintering the density of the sintered object can be improved while suppressing the particle growth of yttrium oxide. Thus it is possible to control electrical conductivity so that the volume resistivity value is 30 cm or more and 1000 cm or less without cutting the route allowing electrical conduction formed by the fibrous carbon.

Hereinafter the present invention will be further specifically described by examples and comparative examples but the present invention is not limited to the examples mentioned below.
