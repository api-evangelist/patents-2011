The present invention relates to the field of inkjet printing and in particular discloses a method of manufacture of an ink jet printer having a thermal actuator comprising an external coil spring.

Many ink jet printing mechanisms are known. Unfortunately in mass production techniques the production of ink jet heads is quite difficult. For example often the orifice or nozzle plate is constructed separately from the ink supply and ink ejection mechanism and bonded to the mechanism at a later stage Hewlett Packard Journal Vol. 36 no 5 pp33 37 1985 . These separate material processing steps required in handling such precision devices often add a substantial expense in manufacturing.

Additionally side shooting ink jet technologies U.S. Pat. No. 4 899 181 are often used but again this limits the amount of mass production throughput given any particular capital investment.

Additionally more esoteric techniques are also often utilised. These can include electroforming of nickel stage Hewlett Packard Journal Vol. 36 no 5 pp33 37 1985 electro discharge machining laser ablation U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 604 micro punching etc.

The utilisation of the above techniques is likely to add substantial expense to the mass production of ink jet print heads and therefore add substantially to their final cost.

It would therefore be desirable if an efficient system for the mass production of ink jet print heads could be developed.

In accordance with an aspect of the present invention there is provided a micro electromechanical ejection mechanism comprising 

an ink chamber formed on said wafer substrate the ink chamber having an ink ejection nozzle formed in a roof thereof and an ink inlet port formed in a floor thereof 

a bi layer thermal actuator coil with a first end fast with the substrate and a second end connected to the paddle device wherein heating of the thermal actuator coil displaces the paddle device causing ejection of an ink droplet through the ink ejection nozzle.

In the preferred embodiment there is provided an inkjet printer having a series of ink ejection mechanisms wherein each ink ejection mechanism includes a paddle actuated by a coil actuator the coil spring actuator having a unique cross section so as to provide for efficient actuation as a coiled thermal actuator.

Turning initially to there is illustrated a single ink ejection mechanism constructed in accordance with the principles of the preferred embodiment. The ink ejection mechanism includes a chamber having a rim . The chamber is normally filled with ink which bulges out around a surface having a border along the edge of rim the ink being retained within the chamber by means of surface tension around the rim . Outside of the chamber is located a thermal actuator device . The thermal actuator device is interconnected via a strut through a hole to a paddle device within the chamber . The strut and hole are treated so as to be hydrophobic. Further the hole is provided in a thin elongated form so that surface tension characteristics also assist in stopping any ink from flowing out of the hole .

The thermal actuator device comprises a first arm portion which can be constructed from glass or other suitable non conductive material. A second arm portion can be constructed from material such as titanium diboride which has a large Young s modulus or bending strength and hence when a current is passed through the titanium diboride layer it expands with a predetermined coefficient of thermal expansion. The thin strip has a high Young s modulus or bending strength and therefore the thin strip is able to bend the much thicker strip which has a substantially lower Young s modulus.

Turning to there is illustrated a cross section of the arm through the line II II of illustrating the structure of the actuator device . As described previously the actuator device includes two titanium diboride portions forming a circuit around the coil in addition to the glass portion which also provides for electrical isolation of the two arms the arms being conductively joined at the strut end.

Turning now to there will now be explaining the operation of the ink ejection mechanism for the ejection of ink. Initially before the paddle has started moving the situation is as illustrated in with the nozzle chamber being filled with ink and having a slightly bulging meniscus . Upon actuation of the actuator mechanism the paddle begins to move towards the nozzle rim resulting in a substantial increase in pressure in the area around the nozzle rim . This in turn results in the situation as illustrated in wherein the meniscus begins to significantly bulge as a result of the increases in pressure. Subsequently the actuator is deactivated resulting in a general urge for the paddle to return to its rest position. This results in the ink being sucked back into the chamber which in turn results in the meniscus necking and breaking off into a meniscus and ink drop the drop proceeding to a paper or film medium not shown for marking. The meniscus has generally a concave shape and surface tension characteristics result in chamber refilling by means of in flow from an ink supply channel etched through the wafer. The refilling is as a consequence of surface tension forces on the meniscus . Eventually the meniscus returns to its quiescent state as illustrated in .

Turning now to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single ink ejection mechanism illustrating the various material layers. The ink ejection mechanism can be formed as part of a large array of mechanisms forming a print head with multiple print heads being simultaneously formed on a silicon wafer . The wafer is initially processed so as to incorporate a standard CMOS circuitry layer which provides for the electrical interconnect for the control of the conductive portions of the actuator. The CMOS layer can be completed with a silicon nitride passivation layer so as to protect it from subsequent processing steps in addition to ink flows through channel . The subsequent layers eg. and can be deposited utilising standard micro electro mechanical systems MEMS construction techniques including the deposit of sacrificial aluminum layers in addition to the deposit of the layers constructed from titanium diboride the layer constructed from glass material and the nozzle chamber proper again constructed from titanium diboride. Each of these layers can be built up in a sacrificial material such as aluminum which is subsequently etched away. Further an ink supply channel eg. can be etched through the wafer . The etching can be by means of an isotropic crystallographic silicon etch or an isotropic dry etch. A dry etch system capable of high aspect ratio silicon trench etching such as the Surface Technology Systems STS Advance Silicon Etch ASE system is recommended.

Subsequent to construction of the nozzle arrangement it can be attached to an ink supply apparatus for supplying ink to the reverse surface of the wafer so that ink can flow into chamber .

The external surface of nozzle chamber including rim in addition to the area surrounding slot can then be hydrophobically treated so as to reduce the possibility of any ink exiting slot .

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet print heads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

The presently disclosed ink jet printing technology is potentially suited to a wide range of printing system including color and monochrome office printers short run digital printers high speed digital printers offset press supplemental printers low cost scanning printers high speed pagewidth printers notebook computers with in built pagewidth printers portable color and monochrome printers color and monochrome copiers color and monochrome facsimile machines combined printer facsimile and copying machines label printers large format plotters photograph copiers printers for digital photographic minilabs video printers PHOTO CD PHOTO CD is a registered trade mark of the Eastman Kodak Company printers portable printers for PDAs wallpaper printers indoor sign printers billboard printers fabric printers camera printers and fault tolerant commercial printer arrays.

It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.

The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.

The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed and stems from the energy inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity and must be superheated in thermal ink jet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02 from electricity input to drop momentum and increased surface area out.

The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth print heads with 19 200 nozzles.

Ideally the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in camera digital color printing and other high quality high speed low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include 

All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty five different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table above under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.

The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems from battery powered one time use digital cameras through to desktop and network printers and through to commercial printing systems

For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications the print head is 100 mm long with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38 which is 0.35 mm wide giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19 200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.

Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.

Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.

The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 which matches the docket numbers in the in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.

Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these forty five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet print heads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.

Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 to IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases a printer may be listed more than once in a table where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.

Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include Home printers Office network printers Short run digital printers Commercial print systems Fabric printers Pocket printers Internet WWW printers Video printers Medical imaging Wide format printers Notebook PC printers Fax machines Industrial printing systems Photocopiers Photographic minilabs etc.

The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.
