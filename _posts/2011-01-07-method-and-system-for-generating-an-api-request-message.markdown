This invention relates generally to providing access to a computer system through an open application programming interface API and more particularly to network based methods and systems for providing developers of software applications access to a service provider computer system through an open API architecture.

There are service provider companies that provide a variety of services to numerous consumers. These service provider companies utilize computer systems to provide these services. For example in the financial industry companies such as large banks interchange networks and payment networks provide certain financial services to consumers companies and other banks. Oftentimes these service provider companies provide services that include receiving processing and storing financial data in computer systems managed by the service provider companies. In many cases access to this financial data is restricted to certain approved users. Restricting access to such financial data provides at least some protection for the data. However it also limits the potential uses of the data.

Software developers around the world are able to develop computer programs sometimes called applications which are configured to utilize data such as the data stored within computer systems used by certain service provider companies. Of course in order for these computer programs to use such data the developer programs must be able to access the data and be able to request the data in a proper format. One way to access the data stored by these service provider companies is through an open application programming interface API .

By allowing software developers to access data stored within computer system used by these service provider companies the service provider companies are able to leverage these developer applications as well as increase their transaction volume. Thus by providing this data access to developers these service provider companies are able to provide additional services to both existing and new customers which in turn improves the profitability of these companies. However the providing of such data access also creates certain risks and challenges for the service provider companies.

Accordingly it would be desirable to provide a computer system having an open API that could be used by certain service provider companies such as financial transaction companies that is configured to i permit access to a library of API services ii prompt a developer to test data requests that are required to be in a predetermined format and iii display results of the requests made in the predetermined format or an instructive error message.

In one embodiment a computer system for generating an API request message for an API service application stored within a service owner SO computer device includes a memory device for storing data and a service provider SP computer system including a processor and an open application programming interface API platform the SP computer system in communication with the memory device and the SO computer device. The SP computer system is programmed to receive from a developer a plurality of selections of parameters defining an API service request generate an API request message for a specific API service using the received parameter selections the API request message including the received parameter selections in a predetermined format required by the specific API service generate a response to the generated API request message and display the generated API request message and response on a single webpage.

In another embodiment a computer implemented method of generating an API request message for an API service application stored within a service provider SP computer system through an open application programming interface API platform includes receiving from a developer a plurality of selections of parameters defining an API service request generating an API request message for a specific API service using the received parameter selections the API request message including the received parameter selections in a predetermined format required by the specific API service generating a response to the generated API request message and displaying the generated API request message and response on a single webpage.

In yet another embodiment one or more computer readable non transitory media includes a computer executable program that instructs at least one processor to generate an API request message for an API service application stored within a service provider SP computer system through an open application programming interface API platform. The computer executable program including at least one code segment that instructs the at least one processor to receive from a developer a plurality of selections of parameters defining an API service request generate an API request message for a specific API service using the received parameter selections the API request message including the received parameter selections in a predetermined format required by the specific API service generate a response to the generated API request message and display the generated API request message and response on a single webpage.

More specifically in the example embodiment system includes a server system which is a type of computer system and a plurality of client sub systems also referred to as client systems and connected to server system . In one embodiment client systems are computers including a web browser such that server system is accessible to client systems using the Internet. Client systems are interconnected to the Internet through many interfaces including a network such as a local area network LAN or a wide area network WAN dial in connections cable modems and special high speed ISDN lines. Client systems could be any device capable of interconnecting to the Internet including a web based phone personal digital assistant PDA or other web based connectable equipment.

System also includes point of sale POS terminals which may be connected to client systems and may be connected to server system . POS terminals are interconnected to the Internet through many interfaces including a network such as a local area network LAN or a wide area network WAN dial in connections cable modems wireless modems and special high speed ISDN lines. POS terminals could be any device capable of interconnecting to the Internet and including an input device capable of reading information from a consumer s financial transaction card.

A database server is connected to database which contains information on a variety of matters as described below in greater detail. In one embodiment centralized database is stored on server system and can be accessed by potential users at one of client systems by logging onto server system through one of client systems . In an alternative embodiment database is stored remotely from server system and may be non centralized.

Database may store transaction data generated as part of sales activities conducted over the services network including data relating to merchants account holders or customers developers issuers acquirers purchases made and services provided by system . Database may also store account data including at least one of a cardholder name a cardholder address an account number and other account identifier. Database may also store merchant data including a merchant identifier that identifies each merchant registered to use the network and instructions for settling transactions including merchant bank account information. Database may also store purchase data associated with items being purchased by a cardholder from a merchant and authorization request data.

In the example embodiment client system may be associated with a developer of computer applications and may be referred to as a developer computer device and client system may be associated with a consumer an acquirer or an issuer and may be referred to as a user computer device. Developer computer device stores developer applications that a user may access and utilize via user computer device . Server system may be associated with a service provider SP and may be referred to as a SP computer device. In the example embodiment an SP may include a payment network provider an interchange network provider or any other provider of financial or non financial services.

In the embodiment where the SP is an interchange network provider system includes POS terminals which may be associated with a merchant. In this embodiment system may be part of a multi party payment card industry system for enabling ordinary payment by card transactions such as a credit card payment system using the MasterCard interchange. The MasterCard interchange is a proprietary communications standard promulgated by MasterCard International Incorporated for the exchange of financial transaction data between financial institutions that are members of MasterCard International Incorporated . MasterCard is a registered trademark of MasterCard International Incorporated located in Purchase N.Y. .

For example in a typical payment card system a financial institution called the issuer issues a payment card such as a credit card to a consumer who uses the payment card to tender payment for a purchase from a merchant. To accept payment with the payment card the merchant must normally establish an account with a financial institution that is part of the financial payment system. This financial institution is usually called the merchant bank or the acquiring bank or acquirer bank. When a consumer tenders payment for a purchase with a payment card also known as a financial transaction card the merchant requests authorization from the merchant bank for the amount of the purchase. The request may be performed over the telephone but is usually performed through the use of a point of sale terminal which reads the consumer s account information from the magnetic stripe on the payment card and communicates electronically with the transaction processing computers of the merchant bank. Alternatively a merchant bank may authorize a third party to perform transaction processing on its behalf. In this case the point of sale terminal will be configured to communicate with the third party. Such a third party is usually called a merchant processor or an acquiring processor. 

Using the interchange network the computers of the merchant bank or the merchant processor will communicate with the computers of the issuer bank to determine whether the consumer s account is in good standing and whether the purchase is covered by the consumer s available credit line. Based on these determinations the request for authorization will be declined or accepted. If the request is accepted an authorization code is issued to the merchant.

When a request for authorization is accepted the available credit line of consumer s account is decreased. Normally a charge is not posted immediately to a consumer s account because bankcard associations such as MasterCard International Incorporated have promulgated rules that do not allow a merchant to charge or capture a transaction until goods are shipped or services are delivered. When a merchant ships or delivers the goods or services the merchant captures the transaction by for example appropriate data entry procedures on the point of sale terminal. If a consumer cancels a transaction before it is captured a void is generated. If a consumer returns goods after the transaction has been captured a credit is generated.

For debit card transactions when a request for a PIN authorization is approved by the issuer the consumer s account is decreased. Normally a charge is posted immediately to a consumer s account. The bankcard association then transmits the approval to the acquiring processor for distribution of goods services or information or cash in the case of an ATM.

After a transaction is captured the transaction is settled between the merchant the merchant bank and the issuer. Settlement refers to the transfer of financial data or funds between the merchant s account the merchant bank and the issuer related to the transaction. Usually transactions are captured and accumulated into a batch which is settled as a group.

The financial transaction cards or payment cards discussed herein may include credit cards debit cards a charge card a membership card a promotional card prepaid cards and gift cards. These cards can all be used as a method of payment for performing a transaction. As described herein the term financial transaction card or payment card includes cards such as credit cards debit cards and prepaid cards but also includes any other devices that may hold payment account information such as mobile phones personal digital assistants PDAs and key fobs.

Although the SP has been described herein as an interchange network provider it does not have to be so limited. As indicated above the SP may also be a payment network provider or any other provider of financial services. In these embodiments a transaction card a payment or even a purchase are not necessarily needed to utilize the services provided by the SP. In another embodiment the SP may include any provider of financial or non financial services.

Memory areas and may include but are not limited to random access memory RAM such as dynamic RAM DRAM or static RAM SRAM read only memory ROM erasable programmable read only memory EPROM electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM and non volatile RAM NVRAM . The above memory types are exemplary only and are thus not limiting as to the types of memory usable for storage of a computer program.

Developer computer device includes a processor for executing instructions. Instructions may be stored in a memory area. The memory area may also include one or more developer applications . Applications include computer implemented instructions that cause a computer device to interact with another computer device. For example a developer may create an application for locating ATMs included within a network of ATMs serviced by the SP referred to as the ATM Locator App . The ATM Locator App can be stored within the memory area for use by computer device . Developer computer device is in communication with SP computer system through a developer portal and through a developer sandbox platform . As explained below in greater detail sandbox platform is a test platform provided by SP computer system that enables a developer to test its applications with test data before such applications are rolled out for processing live production data.

SP computer system includes API portal memory device sandbox platform API platform certificate signing server API services wrapper and SO computer systems .

API portal is configured to communicate with developer computer device and facilitates managing developer registration and login with system . API portal also enables developer computer device to communicate with API platform . API portal communicates with memory device to facilitate a login by a developer.

API platform includes a registration service that is used to register developers and developer applications with SP computer system . Registration service is in communication with certificate signing server . API platform also includes an API gateway proxy .

API platform is in communication with API services wrapper . API services wrapper includes wrappers for each service application provided by an SO within SP computer system . Service applications are stored at SO computer systems . SO computer systems are in communication with API platform through API services wrapper or may be connected directly with API platform without a wrapper.

Continuing with the ATM Locator App example from above SO computer devices may include a service application that includes data showing a location of each of the ATM machines included within the network serviced by the SP referred to as the ATM Locator Service . In this example the ATM Locator App which is stored on developer computer device is able to communicate with SO computer device through API platform and API services wrapper by developer computer device sending a data request to SO computer device and by receiving a data response back from SO computer device . Developer computer device is then able to display the location of all the ATMs within the SP network or at least some of the ATMs within the network.

Merchant computer device and consumer computer device each include a processor for executing instructions. Instructions may be stored in a memory area. The memory area may also include one or more developer applications downloaded from developer computer device for use by the merchant consumer acquirer and or issuer collectively a user . In other words a developer may develop an application that can be used by a user on their computer devices e.g. a POS device a personal computer smart phone or PDA . The user downloads the application from the developer to their computer device for use by the user. When the user uses developer application merchant and or consumer computer devices communicate with SP computer system through API platform . Continuing with the ATM Locator App example from above the user can download the ATM Locator App from developer computer device . Consumer computer device is then able to communicate with SO computer devices through API platform and API services wrapper by sending a data request to SO computer devices and by receiving a data response back from SO computer devices . Consumer computer device is then able to display the location of all the ATMs within the SP network or at least some of the ATMs with the network.

As discussed above SP computer system includes a developer sandbox platform which enables a developer to test its applications with test data before such applications are rolled out for processing live production data. Sandbox platform includes a copy of API gateway proxy a copy of API services wrapper and simulator computer devices which are configured to simulate SO computer devices . Sandbox platform includes test data that allows a developer to test its applications prior to rolling out applications for production use.

In the example embodiment a developer visits a web portal referred to as API portal designed specifically for SP computer system . At the home page developers will be prompted to register with API platform . The registration process will collect and authenticate as required the following data elements from the developer first name last name username password email address country street address city state province postal code phone number and company university affiliation. Additionally as a condition of registration developers must opt in to the program by affirmatively consenting to the terms and conditions and privacy notice. API portal also includes a mechanism for the developers to request access to their information in the event that they desire to change modify or delete such information.

Once registered and authenticated developers can log into API portal and access a variety of information regarding the various service applications e.g. service offerings such as payments locators offers MATCH etc. . Each service application will have its own page s dedicated to describing the business requirements and specifications for that service in a format easily understood by non industry developers.

Additionally the developers will be able to log into API portal register a key alias and request a sandbox key. The sandbox key allows developer s applications to access sandbox platform which is an environment where developers can test and validate messages using service simulators .

Once a developer has been given a sandbox key the developer can return to API portal at any time and request a production key. A production key and client ID will be issued for the key alias used by the developer in the developer application. The client ID will identify which key alias is using API platform to process messages and the developer that owns the production key. In the example embodiment sandbox and production keys are not intended to be transferable or shared.

For every message that API platform processes the following will be logged message request type date and time received path message URL IP address of sender user agent of sender name of sending application like IE Firefox or a different name process time and success or fail. If fail then error information client ID key alias user ID system generated ID for developer account that owns the client ID and unique message ID. There may be additional data elements collected based on the differing requirements of the various API service offerings. For example for payments that have a merchant a merchant ID will be logged in addition to the elements listed above.

In the example embodiment a developer is required to register with SP computer system to access certain information. However an unregistered developer is able to access some information within SP computer system . For example an unregistered developer can review available API information documentation and sample code access certain functions and access community pages and read forums. However an unregistered developer cannot post forum comments or blogs create a key alias or request a sandbox or production key.

API portal provides a mechanism for developers to learn about the services that are available. They have the ability to register communicate with other developers via the forums request keys for sandbox testing and production environments view their personal dashboard and view metrics on transactions for each key alias they have created. The keys provide message security between the developers and SP computer system .

SP computer system allows a developer to interact with API sandbox platform . The developer uses sandbox platform for testing and validating applications by using simulators . The messages sent by developer applications to API gateway proxy copy are verified with a key. The key verifies that the message was not tampered with between the sender and SP computer system . The transaction in the message is authenticated by the backend simulator computer devices . The following data elements are collected from the developer during the sandbox key request process 1 Key Alias This is the alias the developer assigns to the key. It is used to present a user friendly identifier of the key on the dashboard. The dashboard is a web page on the portal website with the purpose of automatically displaying important information objects etc. 2 Description The description of the key. It is assigned by the developer. Used on the dashboard to present the developer with a description of the key. 3 Use This identifies if the key is for personal or commercial use. Personal use is an individual that intents to personally use or give to others for their personal use without charge. Commercial use is an individual that is developing for use by their employer or an individual that intends to sell their application to others. 4 Notes This is free form notes that the developer can associate with the key. 5 Calls This is the expected number of calls using the production key. It is assigned by the developer. Used by the SP for capacity planning 6 Profitable This identifies if the developer intends the key to be used to generate a profit. It is assigned by the developer. 7 Certificate The SP signs the certificate and makes it available to the developer on the dashboard to download. The developer sandbox key is valid for testing all available API service applications with general access and any premium services that the developer key alias and client ID have an approved production key.

SP computer system assigns a production key to a developer. During this phase the developer will be assigned a production key number and that key number will be provided to SP computer system during each call. SP computer system will use the production key number to control access and track developer activity throughout the process. In the example embodiment an existing key alias and sandbox key are required prior to requesting a production key. The following data elements are collected from the developer during the production key request process 1 Certificate SP computer system signs the certificate and makes it available to the developer on the dashboard to download. 2 Production Services Requested This is a request for which services the production key will be valid.

A developer is able to engage a customer of the SP. The developer can build applications for any of SP s business partners including merchants issuers acquirers or any other party in the SP network. The following examples describe a developer building a developer application for a merchant user the user could also be an individual an acquirer a processor or an issuer . The developer may be working directly for a merchant or for themselves to sell their application to a merchant. The roles of the developer and merchant are separate. The SP does not have to be part of the relationship between the developer and the merchant. In some embodiments the merchant may be required to have a relationship with the service application being used e.g. MiGS MasterCard Internet Gateway System . The merchant and merchant acquirer would need to be registered with MiGS and have the credentials to prove that relationship is valid prior to using API platform .

In the example embodiment the SP has a trust relationship with an existing merchant. The messages sent by merchant computer device using developer application to API gateway proxy are verified with a key public and private key . The key verifies that the message was not tampered with between the sender and API platform . The transaction in the message is authenticated by the backend service application . During this phase customer authentication is managed by the SO of service application being called.

In the example embodiment SP computer system includes a certificate signing request CSR and a key generation process. This process is started by the developer after registration on API portal . The keys certificates are generated by the developer outside of SP computer system with open source tools like Open SSL . The SP does not own the developer s private or public key. A developer could theoretically use the same key with multiple open API s or programs not just the open API of the SP. The developer owns their private key public key and CSR Certificate Signature Request . The basic steps in the process are as follows 1 the developer uses an open source tool and requests a CSR 2 the tool provides a private and public key pair and the public key is included in the CSR 3 the developer uploads the CSR which contains the public key to API platform 4 API platform assigns a client ID and signs the developer s public key wherein the combination of the client ID and the signed developer s public key comprises the production key 5 the developer then uses the client ID which is included in the production key in each message sent to API platform that is digitally signed with the private key on developer s computer device 6 API platform uses the client ID to identify which public key to use to verify the private key used to sign the message. Tools used to create keys and a CSR typically ask the developer to enter the following information when creating a CSR and key pair name organization organizational unit city state or province and country.

API Explorer is programmed to indicate to the developer which of the plurality of selections of parameters are optional and which are required for generating the API request message. API Explorer is also programmed to indicate to the developer when at least one of the plurality of selections of parameters are outside a predetermined range.

API Explorer is configured to generate an API request message for API service using received parameter selections and wherein API request message includes received parameter selections and in a predetermined format required by selected API service . API Explorer generates a properly formatted response to the generated API request message for the developer to review and understand the particular formatting for requests that are made to the particular API service. API Explorer then displays both generated API request message and generated response on a single webpage API Explorer .
