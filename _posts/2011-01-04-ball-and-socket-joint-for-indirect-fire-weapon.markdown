A mortar is an example of an indirect fire weapon. A known mortar is the M224 60 mm millimeter mortar system. The M224 mortar system includes three different base plates a cannon assembly a bipod assembly and a sight unit. The cannon assembly is the M225 cannon assembly which includes a 60 mm tube and a base cap for the tube. One of the base plates known as the M7 base plate is used with the M225 cannon assembly and the bipod assembly for sustained operations. During sustained operations the bipod assembly supports the 60 mm tube.

Another of the base plates known as the M8 is a smaller base plate used primarily in the system s hand held mode during offensive or mobile operations. The M8 base plate is significantly lighter than the M7 base plate. But the M8 base plate limits the range and directions the mortar can be fired.

The third base plate known as the M8X has the weight advantage of the M8 base plate. When using the M8X base plate the M225 cannon can be fired in the same ranges and directions as when using the M7 base plate. However the M8X base plate uses the M7 style of interface between the cannon assembly and the base plate. The M7 and M8X style of interface does not allow the M224 mortar system to be carried in the hand held mode fully assembled and ready to fire.

The M225 cannon assembly is connected to the M7 and M8X base plates via a ball and socket joint. The ball and socket joint allows freedom of movement traverse and elevation of the cannon assembly to facilitate all required angles of fire. However there are several combinations of traverse and elevation angles where the cannon assembly can become separated from the base plate. Because of these multiple angle combinations where the cannon assembly and base plate can become disengaged the base plate may fall free from the base cap. This may occur when a warfighter lifts the mortar system by the handle in the hand held mode for example to quickly reposition the mortar system to respond to a new threat or call for fire. The M8 base plate does not have the problem of the base cap and base plate disengaging because the M8 base plate uses a clamp to hold the assembly together. However the M8 base plate clamp limits the use of the M224 system in the handheld configuration.

Proposed solutions involve either a complete redesign of the base cap or the addition of multiple small parts to the assembly. A complete redesign of the base cap may cause the loss of a significant investment in the base cap production tooling casting and forging dies . The addition of multiple small parts may increase the logistical burden require additional assembly steps and increase the risk of losing of one or more of the small parts during operations.

A need exists for an apparatus to enable use of the light weight M8X base plate in the hand held mode of the M224 mortar system but with the full range of traverse and elevation equivalent to the heavy M7 base plate.

It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus to enable use of the light weight M8X base plate in the hand held mode of the M224 mortar system but with the full range of traverse and elevation equivalent to the heavy M7 base plate.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus including a member with a ball end and a socket. The ball end of the member may be insertable in the socket at only a single combination of traverse angle and elevation angle of the member. The member may include a base cap.

The generally spherical surface may include a fifth flat having a bisecting plane that is orthogonal to a bisecting plane of the first and second pairs of opposed flats. The fifth flat may lie in a plane angled at about 45 degrees with respect to a plane that 1 contains the longitudinal axis of the base cap and 2 is orthogonal to a plane containing the handle mounting face.

The socket cap may receive the ball end of the base cap. The socket cap may include an annular disk with an annular bottom surface. The annular bottom surface may have a central circular opening. The central circular opening may have a center and a diameter of a size to form a clearance fit with the spherical surface of the ball end of the base cap.

The socket cap may include a first surface defined by a spherical surface centered at the center of the circular opening in the annular bottom surface and having a same diameter as the circular opening. The socket cap may include second and third surfaces defined by a pair of spaced apart parallel planes orthogonal to the annular bottom surface and parallel to a bisecting plane of the socket cap.

The socket cap may include a fourth surface defined by a surface angled with respect to a plane of the annular bottom surface. The fourth surface may extend from the first surface circumferentially and be centered about the bisecting plane of the socket cap.

The socket cap may include a fifth surface defined by a generally right circular cylinder having a longitudinal axis that intersects the center of the circular opening and is normal to the plane of the annular bottom surface. The socket cap may include a sixth surface defined by a plane parallel to and spaced apart from the annular bottom surface. The socket cap may include a seventh surface defined by a plane orthogonal to the sixth surface and the bisecting plane of the socket cap.

Eighth and ninth opposed surfaces of the socket cap may be defined by a right circular cylinder disposed symmetrically with respect to the bisecting plane and having a longitudinal axis that includes center C. The diameter of the right circular cylinder that defines the eighth and ninth opposed surfaces may be about equal to D.

Tenth and eleventh surfaces of the socket cap may be defined by a pair of opposed right circular cylinders with longitudinal axes that form an angle with the plane of the annular bottom surface form an angle with respect to the bisecting plane and are symmetric with respect to the bisecting plane.

The apparatus may include a base plate. The socket cap may be rotatably disposed in the base plate. The base cap may be rotatable in the base plate through 360 degrees of traverse. An angle of elevation of the base cap may vary from vertical to about 45 degrees from vertical.

A distance between the second and third surfaces may be a clearance fit with the first pair of opposed flats. A circumferential extent of the fourth surface may be about 120 degrees. The fourth surface may be angled at about 45 degrees with respect to the plane of the annular bottom surface.

The eighth and ninth opposed surfaces may include first edges that abut the seventh surface and the spherical surface and second edges that abut the second and third surfaces respectively.

The apparatus may include a tab that projects above the sixth surface and abuts the seventh surface. The bisecting plane of the socket cap may bisect the tab and the seventh surface.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel base cap and a novel socket cap for an indirect fire weapon may enable use of the existing light weight M8X base plate in the hand held mode of the M224 mortar system but with the full range of traverse and elevation equivalent to the heavy M7 base plate. The novel base cap may be made by modifying the known base cap for the M225 cannon assembly. The modification to the known base cap may be accomplished at the unit level if necessary. The novel socket cap may replace the known socket cap in the M8X base plate. The known socket cap may be easily removed from the M8X base plate. The novel socket cap may be easily inserted in the M8X base plate at the unit level. An advantage of the invention is that the number of separate parts in the cannon assembly does not change. One known part of the cannon assembly the base cap may be modified and the known socket cap may be replaced by the novel socket cap.

Fifth flat may lie in a plane angled at an angle K with respect to a plane that 1 contains the longitudinal axis A of base cap and 2 is orthogonal to a plane containing handle mounting face . In one embodiment angle K may be about 45 degrees.

Base plate for example an MX8 base plate may include an opening for receiving a novel socket or socket cap . Socket cap may be rotatable in opening in base plate . Socket cap may be secured in opening with a known spring type retaining ring not shown . When properly inserted in socket cap base cap attached to cannon may be secured to base plate in all combinations of traverse azimuth and elevation angles except for one.

To insert base cap into socket cap or to remove base cap from socket cap one may be required to position base cap at a specific traverse angle plus or minus about one degree and a specific elevation angle plus or minus about one degree . At the specific traverse angle and elevation angle base cap with attached cannon may be lowered straight down into socket cap or lifted straight up out of socket cap . At any other combination of traverse and elevation angles base cap may not be removed from socket cap . Thus the mortar system may be carried fully assembled without base plate separating from base cap .

Socket cap may include an annular disk with an annular bottom surface . Annular bottom surface may have a central circular opening . Circular opening may have a center C and a diameter D.

A first surface of socket cap may be defined by a spherical surface centered at center C of circular opening and having a same diameter D as circular opening .

Second and third surfaces of socket cap may be defined by a pair of spaced apart parallel planes that are orthogonal to annular bottom surface and parallel to a bisecting plane of socket cap . The bisecting plane of socket cap is defined as the plane that contains the section line D D of and is orthogonal to the annular bottom surface .

A fourth surface of socket cap may be defined by a surface angled at an angle G with respect to the plane of annular bottom surface . Angle G may represent the approximate minimum degree of elevation of cannon from the horizontal. In one embodiment angle G may be for example about 40 to 50 degrees. Fourth surface may extend from first surface over a circumferential extent of H degrees . The circumferential extent H of fourth surface may define the amount one may traverse cannon without additionally rotating socket cap in opening in base plate . Of course because socket cap may be rotatable in opening cannon may be traversed a full 360 degrees. The circumferential extent H of fourth surface may be for example about 120 degrees. The circumferential extent H of fourth surface may be centered about the bisecting plane of socket cap .

A fifth surface of socket cap may be defined by a generally right circular cylinder having a longitudinal axis that intersects center C of circular opening and is normal to the plane of annular bottom surface . The cylinder that defines fifth surface may have a diameter of about 60 mm for example.

A seventh surface of socket cap may be defined by a plane that is orthogonal to sixth surface orthogonal to the bisecting plane of socket cap and symmetric with respect to the bisecting plane of cap .

Longitudinal axes of the cylinders that define surfaces may form an angle J with the plane of annular bottom surface . The longitudinal axis T of one of the cylinders is shown in . In the cylinder surface that defines surface is shown in phantom lines. Angle J may represent about the minimum angle of elevation of cannon from the horizontal and may be the same as angle G. The longitudinal axes of the cylinders that define surfaces may be located at an angle of about H 2 from the bisecting plane of the socket cap .

Socket cap may include a tab that is symmetric with respect to the bisecting plane of cap and that abuts seventh surface . Tab may have two functions. Tab may function as a handle to rotate socket cap in opening in base plate . Tab may function as an easily visible means of locating the bisecting plane of socket cap to thereby insert or remove base cap from socket cap .

From the position shown in if base cap is rotated upward clockwise or counterclockwise by about 2 degrees then base cap cannot be separated from socket cap . To securely connect base cap to socket cap base cap may then be rotated upward to the vertical position as shown in . Then base cap may be rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise or clockwise as shown in . Cannon attached to base cap may then be traversed 360 degrees and may be elevated from angle G upward to the vertical without base cap separating from socket cap .
