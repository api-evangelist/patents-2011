The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to a device for deployment from a cruise missile and more particularly for submunition that is capable of deploying small unmanned aerial vehicles.

Tomahawk cruise missile variant UGM 109D is designed to deliver four payload modules of six small submunitions each to multiple targets. Submunitions are positioned in a submunition compartment with a close sliding fit and are retained in the compartment by a submunition latch. The submunition is deployed by a charge positioned in the submunition compartment which moves the submunition into the slipstream around the missile. Once the submunition enters the slipstream around the missile aerodynamic forces pull it away from the missile. A submunition is typically an explosive weapon however other uses have been contemplated for this capability.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 498 767 to Carreiro was issued for a Cruise Missile Deployed Sonar Buoy . This patent teaches a sonar buoy adapted to be deployed by a cruise missile from its submunition compartment. The sonar buoy includes a flotation device for keeping a portion of the buoy afloat a hydrophone a transmitter for communicating contact and position information and releasable means for attaching the sonar buoy to the cruise missile. By means of this device a means of monitoring littoral and other waters for enemy submarines and other threats is provided with a low degree of risk to friendly forces. A system for deploying this sonar buoy in a sonar buoy field is also disclosed.

Also relevant is U.S. Pat. No. 6 484 641 for a Cruise Missile Downed Airman Decoy . This patent teaches that a cruise missile such as the Tomahawk cruise missile can be adapted to deploy decoys in an area as the missile progresses along its preprogrammed course. Each decoy is shaped to be compatible with and ejected from the Tomahawk missile submunition compartment and has a preprogrammed control unit operating a transmitter connected to an extendible antenna. False beacon signals and or false message signals are transmitted from each of the decoys to deceive and confuse defensive forces such as enemy searchers looking for a downed airman.

Unmanned aerial vehicles have been a recent addition to ground combat. Of relevance to the current invention are micro unmanned aerial vehicles MUAVs . Known MUAVs are less than six inches in length with a maximum range of approximately seven miles and flight endurance of up to one hour. The MUAV can deploy useful micro payloads to a remote or otherwise hazardous location where it may perform any of a variety of missions including reconnaissance and tagging high value targets bio chemical detection and classification battle damage imaging and assessment and search and rescue. For these purposes the MUAV can be equipped with an appropriate sensor joined to a transmitter.

The MUAV is controlled externally by directional antennas from ground surface ship submarine or airborne platforms. The MUAVs acting alone or in small cooperative groups can provide reconnaissance and surveillance of inner city areas serve as communication relays and place sensors on elevated surfaces.

Although the MUAV serves well in its intended purpose one serious limitation of the MUAV is its limited range and endurance. Consequently MUAVs must be deployed relatively close to their selected area of operation. It is desired that means be provided to extend the range of operation of the weapon system such as the weapon system deploying MUAVs.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide means for extending the range of operation of a weapon system deploying MUAVs.

Another object of the present invention is to provide means for adapting a system for dispensing submunitions to dispensing submunitions such as MUAVs having a limited range.

In accordance with the present invention there is provided a micro unmanned aerial vehicle deployment system for a cruise missile having submunition compartments. The system includes a vehicle launch module releasable from the cruise missile submunition compartment. The vehicle launch system has a control circuit and at least one micro unmanned aerial vehicle contained therein. Structure is provided in the launch module for deploying the micro unmanned aerial vehicle. The system can include a separable tether joined between the cruise missile and the vehicle launch module that separates when subjected to tension after deployment of the vehicle launch module.

As discussed previously deploying multiple Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle MUAV has many benefits but there are limitations concerning its range of operation. The present invention eliminates the range limitation by adapting a system for dispensing multiple short range vehicles into a known submunition deployment system. The known submunition deployment system utilizes a cruise missile such as a Tomahawk variant UGM 109D. This type of missile can be launched from submarine surface or airborne locations. The present invention allows the MUAV to be insertable into and ejected from enclosed spaces of the missile both in a close sliding fit. More particularly the present invention eliminates the problem of limited range by employing a cruise missile to dispense multiple MUAVs. The operation of the present invention may be better understood by first referring to .

As seen in the payload module such as has six submunition compartments and . Each of the six submunition compartments can hold a submunition that is separately ejectable from the defined payload module identified typically at . In general the present invention provides a module assembly that allows one submunition to support and dispense multiple micro unmanned aerial vehicles.

The module assembly comprises a shell which has the substantially same external dimensions as the internal dimensions of submunition payload . . . . The shell provides environmental protection to the internal components and acts as a launch platform for MUAVs. These MUAVs are shown in as MUAV and . MUAVs and are shown with a propeller and wings however another propulsion means such as a ducted fan jet engine rocket engine or the like could be used. MUAVs can have sensors positioned thereon. MUAVs can be remotely controlled and have transmitters allowing them to transmit sensor signals.

The internal volume of module assembly can be divided by shell into five compartments and . Compartments and can be occupied by a respective MUAV and . Compartment is occupied by a parachute .
