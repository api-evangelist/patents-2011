This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10 494 055 entitled ON A SUBSTRATE FORMED OR RESTING DISPLAY ARRANGEMENT filed on Apr. 29 2004 by inventor Magnus George Goertz which claims benefit of PCT Application No. PCT SE02 02000 entitled ON A SUBSTRATE FORMED OR RESTING DISPLAY ARRANGEMENT filed on Nov. 4 2002 by inventor Magnus George Goertz.

The present invention relates generally to a display arrangement that is formed onto or is supported by a substrate and more particularly to a mobile telephone adapted touch screen arrangement which is constructed with and around a display unit whose external dimensions conform with those applicable to mobile telephone apparatus or cell phones.

Mobile telephone displays normally consist of an LCD unit and an associated keypad where depression of a key activates one or more telephone functions.

It can be mentioned with regard to known technology that the use of a touch screen has been proposed with regard to hand carried computer terminals with the intention of reducing the dimensions of a display surface wherein selected functions can be activated through the medium of visible digits or other symbols by exerting pressure on a surface section corresponding to the surface section of the symbol concerned with the aid of a pointer.

Touch screens or touch sheets of this kind have been produced in the form of two mutually parallel plastic sheets where a mechanical actuation of an uppermost sheet within a chosen surface section creates conditions for a resistance measurement perpendicular to said surface section wherein the geographical position of said surface section on the touch screen can be established by a calculating circuit with the aid of the resistance values established and therewith generate a significant signal for a function related to a touched symbol.

In this case there is used a hand held and hand maneuvered elongate pointer having a tip comparable to that of a pencil or pen which requires physical actuation on and pressure against the chosen surface section of the display unit.

Also known to the art are touch screens that have relatively large external dimensions where the dimensions chosen and a chosen screen thickness are of small account and constitute no limitation to the chosen application.

For example it is known in respect of this use application to allow the touch screen to be comprised of a display unit in the form of an LCD unit with edge orientated and mutually opposite light emitting units and light receiving units.

More particularly in the case of this application the light emitting units and the light receiving units are orientated in two rows and two columns over the upper surface of the display unit with the transmitting and receiving directions of the light rays orientated and directed immediately above the upper surface of the display unit with said units directly opposite each other.

Light emitting circuits and light receiving circuits are also mutually co ordinated and connected to a calculating or computing unit in this case so as to evaluate and calculate a position representative of the geographical position on the upper surface of the display unit where mutually intersecting light rays are shadowed by an object serving as a pointer depending on the position of one or more coordinate orientated light receiving units having associated circuits which are intended to indicate the presence of light.

It is known in the case of this latter application to use the tip of an index finger as a pointer and no physical actuation of or pressure against said display surface section is required in this particular technique even though such is usual.

The contents of the patent publications listed below also belong to the earlier standpoint of techniques with regard to the use of a touch screen in which light emitting and light receiving units and the tip of an index finger or the like function to activate signals corresponding to a chosen symbol presented on a surface section of the display surface.

This publication illustrates and describes a control system 10 which in addition to a display panel 22 comprised of liquid crystals also includes a light source 20 and a light detector 36 .

More specifically the publication is concerned with allowing light from the light source to be directed through at least part of the liquid crystal display panel and onto the light detector.

The system 10 includes a casing 12 which is formed to be fitted to the instrument panel of a car said panel including a sunken surface part 14 and being produced from a transparent material.

The light source 20 is illustrated in the form of a fluorescent lamp and is adapted to extend across the full width of the casing.

Light is able to pass through a number of windows 24 in the panel 22 and is reflected through 90 degrees by a mirror surface 26 .

The light shall then pass a transparent casing wall portion 28 and then through the sunken surface portion 14 and thereafter through an opposite wall portion 32 so as to be reflected onto the light detector or light receiver 36 by a mirror surface 34 .

FIG. 1 of this patent publication shows that when a fingertip 49 is placed within the sunken surface 14 a number of light rays are shadowed within a defined area 48 enabling this area to be detected.

FIG. 8 shows a system in which light sources and light detectors or light receivers are orientated in perpendicular co ordinates.

FIGS. 3 and 4 in particular illustrate an optical keyboard 12 which includes an IR adapted light source 32 a light receiver 34 and optical prism or mirror surfaces 36 38 .

In this regard FIG. 3 shows that these mirror surfaces 36 38 are related to mutually opposite edge portions of a window surface 22 .

This publication illustrates and describes a touch screen which is adapted to create control signals by means of which a function can be selected in response to the movement and displacement of an operator s fingertip relative to the screen 1 .

More particularly this publication is concerned with the activation of a time circuit immediately when a finger or a fingertip touches the touch screen where a particular movement direction and a particular distance of movement are detected and an electronic unit or the like is activated in response to these parameters.

The touch screen or touch panel 1 is provided along its four sides with light emitting diodes LED 101 114 and light receiving devices in the form of phototransistors or photodiodes 201 214 as illustrated in FIG. 2.

The finger or the fingertip shadows one or more light beams orientated in a right angled co ordinate system wherein shadowed light receiving devices and detected changes in shaded devices constitute magnitudes from which desired functions are evaluated and initiated.

When taking into consideration the technical deliberations that a person skilled in this particular art must make in order to provide a solution to one or more technical problems that he she encounters it will be seen that it is necessary on the one hand to realise initially the measures and or the sequence of measures that must be undertaken to this end and on the other hand to realise which means is are required to solve one or more of said problems. On this basis it will be evident that the technical problems listed below are highly relevant to the development of the present invention.

Another technical problem resides in the ability to create construction instructions that will provide conditions for reducing the space required by such a touch screen and for adapted planning and placement of said screen within the external confines of a mobile telephone.

A further technical problem resides in the ability to create conditions with the aid of simple means that enable energy consumption and power requirements to be kept low with regard to the mobile telephone being battery powered by generating short light pulses and by allowing the units to be activated sequentially in a chosen order.

When considering the earlier standpoint of techniques as described above it will also be seen that a technical problem resides in the provision of structural changes in a touch screen such as to enable the screen to be significantly thinner than prior art screens so as to adapt said screen directly onto a mobile telephone.

A further technical problem resides in the ability to provide a touch screen with which in respect of other external dimensions of said screen it is possible to create conditions which enable the external measurements of a mobile telephone unit to be reduced while nevertheless enabling the width of the display surface of a display unit to be made larger than the display surface of known mobile telephone units.

Another technical problem resides in the ability to realise the significance of and the advantages afforded by allowing the light deflecting devices or light pulse deflecting devices to consist of a plurality of mirror units co ordinated with the casing of the mobile telephone unit.

Another technical problem resides in the ability to realise the significance of and the advantages associated with allowing said light pulse deflecting devices to consist of four mirror units with their mirror surfaces orientated at 45 degrees in relation to the propagation direction of the light pulses from said angled light pulse generating units and to said angled light pulse receiving units.

A further technical problem resides in the ability to realise the significance of and the advantages associated with allowing said light pulse deflecting devices to consist of a separate right angled equilateral three sided and right angled prism unit having a light pulse deflecting mirror surface or a corresponding means.

Another technical problem resides in the ability to realise the significance of and the advantages afforded by enabling a circuit board or a printed circuit board to carry electronic circuits and components adapted for carrying out functions related to the mobile telephone unit and or to an associated mobile telephone network.

Another technical problem resides in the ability to realise the significance of and the advantages associated with allowing said light pulse emitting units and said light pulse receiving units to be orientated in respective rows and respective columns with mutual perpendicular orientations and with a distance between said rows or columns that only slightly exceeds the dimensions chosen with respect to said display unit.

Another technical problem resides in the ability to realise the significance of and the advantages afforded by fastening the edges of said light pulse deflecting devices along the raised rim portions of a recess in a casing part in the form of a replaceable lid where said rim and said rim portions co act with a transparent protective means such as a plastic sheet.

In respect of certain conditions where a plurality of side related light pulse receiving units and their associated pulse receiving circuits also indicate the absence of light pulses another technical problem resides in the ability to realise the significance of and the advantages that are afforded by adapting the calculating unit to interpret this information with the aid of internal computing circuits as meaning that the intended geographical position shall be considered to be located between outer points representative of said pulse receiving circuits that indicate the absence of light pulses.

In respect of certain conditions where a plurality of angled and side related light pulse receiving units and associated pulse receiving circuits indicate at the same time the absence of light pulses another technical problem resides in the ability to realise the significance of and the advantages afforded by adapting the calculating unit to interpret this information with the aid of internal computing circuits as meaning that the intended geographical position shall be considered to be located between outer points representative of said pulse receiving circuits that indicate the absence of light pulses.

Another technical problem resides in the ability to realise the significance of and the advantages afforded by allowing said light pulse emitting units to be activated through the medium of associated pulse generating circuits either sequentially or in chosen positions in a predetermined order and by allowing the corresponding light pulse receiving units and their pulse receiving circuits to be also activated in said predetermined order.

A further technical problem resides in the ability to realise the significance of and the advantages afforded by adapting a plurality of light pulse emitting units to emit light pulses consecutively over a chosen time duration and by adapting one single light pulse receiving unit to be activated via its pulse receiving circuit so as to receive expected light pulses during said chosen time duration and therewith allow registration of occurring light pulses and or shadowed light pulses or the absence of light pulses.

Another technical problem resides in the ability to realise the significance of and the advantages afforded by adapting a plurality of light pulse receiving circuits so that light pulses emitted from a single light pulse emitting unit can be received consecutively during said time duration and by adapting the light pulse receiving units so that said units will be active via pulse receiving circuits during said chosen time duration for receiving expected light pulses and therewith allow registration of occurring light pulses and or shadowed light pulses or the absence of light pulses.

The present invention takes as its starting point the known technology as it is described above and is based on a touch screen arrangement which is built on or rests on a supportive substrate and which is adapted for a mobile telephone apparatus or set and incorporated in the apparatus with the aid of a known display unit.

With the intention of solving one or more of the aforesaid technical problems related directly to mobile telephone apparatus or sets the invention proposes the use of an arrangement constructed in principle in accordance with what is used and proposed within other technical fields said arrangement comprising a number of light pulse emitting units together with a number of oppositely located light pulse receiving units said units both being edge related to the display unit of said mobile telephone.

The light pulse emitting units are adapted to send light pulses sequentially through a short distance over the upper surface of a display unit via associated pulse generating circuits said upper surface presenting a graphic such as rows and columns of geographically disposed symbols such as letters numbers and or corresponding graphics.

The light pulse receiving units are adapted to receive light pulses sequentially and each of the pulse receiving circuits and pulse emitting circuits are co ordinated and connected to a calculating or computing unit.

The calculating unit will include calculating circuits that function to evaluate a position representative of the geographical position on the upper surface of the display unit where light rays such as intersecting light rays are shadowed by a pointer such as the front surface part of a users thumb depending on the position of one or more co ordinate orientated light pulse receiving units and their associated pulse receiving circuits that should indicate the presence of a light pulse.

By way of proposed embodiments that lie within the scope of the present invention it is particularly proposed that said light pulse emitting units and said light pulse receiving units are orientated adjacent said display unit with the light pulse emitting and light pulse receiving directions being at right angles or at least generally at right angles to a planar upper surface of the display unit.

Also proposed is the use of a number of light pulse deflecting devices such as four devices that are orientated close to the display unit and that function to cause mutually intersecting light pulses to pass parallel across the upper surface of the display unit.

By way of proposed embodiments that lie within the scope of the inventive concept it is also proposed that a supportive substrate is comprised of a circuit board or printed circuit board of the mobile telephone unit.

In addition to carrying the display unit the substrate is also adapted to carry said light pulse emitting and light pulse receiving units.

The light pulse emitting units and the light pulse receiving units are connected to said pulse generating circuits and said pulse receiving circuits coordinated on the supportive substrate by connecting wires or the like.

Each of the light pulse deflecting devices may comprise a mirror unit or a mirror portion carried by the casing to provide a corresponding effect.

The light pulse deflecting devices may comprise mirror units that have mirror surfaces or casing carried mirror surfaces orientated at 45 degrees in relation to the direction of propagation of the light pulses emitted by said light pulse emitting units towards said light pulse receiving units.

The light pulse deflecting devices may also comprise a right angled equilateral three sided and right angled prism unit.

The circuit board or printed circuit board that functions as a substrate may also support electronic circuits and components adapted to perform functions related to the mobile telephone unit or set.

The light pulse emitting units and the light pulse receiving units are orientated in two rows and two columns of mutual perpendicular orientations with a distance between said rows and columns that only slightly exceeds corresponding dimensions of said display unit.

It is also proposed that the circuit board or printed circuit board that includes inter al display units light pulse emitting units light pulse receiving units and fixed components necessary to carry out the normal functions of the mobile telephone unit is adapted to enable it to be fastened to or against part of the casing of the mobile telephone unit.

The light pulse deflecting devices are fastened edge orientated along the raised rims of a replaceable lid or cover said rims or parts of said rims co acting with and supporting a transparent protective device such as a plastic or glass sheet.

It is also proposed in accordance with the invention that conditions are provided whereby when a plurality of side related light pulse receiving units and their associated pulse receiving circuits indicate simultaneously the absence of light pulses the calculating unit will interpret this information with the aid of internal calculating circuits as indicating that the intended geographical position shall be considered to be located at or between points representative of said light pulse receiving units as an indication of the absence of light pulses.

In respect of conditions where a plurality of angled and side related light pulse receiving units and their associated pulse receiving circuits simultaneously indicate the absence of light pulses the calculating unit functions with the aid of internal calculating circuits to interpret this information to mean that the intended geographical position shall be considered to be located at one point or between points representative of said light pulse receiving units that indicate the absence of light pulses.

It is also proposed that when said light pulse emitting units are activated via associated pulse generating circuits either sequentially or positioned selectively in a predetermined order the corresponding pulse receiving circuits shall also be capable of being activated in the same predetermined order.

A plurality of light pulse emitting units may be adapted to consecutively emit light pulses with the aid of said pulse generating circuits over a chosen time duration wherein one single light pulse receiving unit is adapted to be activated to receive anticipated light pulses during said chosen time duration and therewith allow occurring light pulses and or shaded light pulses or the absence of light pulses to be registered through the medium of an associated pulse receiving circuit.

A plurality of light pulse receiving units may be adapted to receive light pulses emitted from one single light pulse emitting unit consecutively during a chosen time period wherein each of the light pulse receiving units is adapted to be activated via associated pulse receiving circuits to receive light pulses during said chosen time period and therewith allow occurring light pulses and shadowed light pulses and or the absence of light pulses to be registered.

Those advantages primarily characteristic of the present invention and the particular significant characteristics of said invention reside in the creation of conditions which enable the creation of a touch screen arrangement for a mobile telephone apparatus or telephone unit or set on the basis of the technology described in the introduction wherein edge related light pulse emitting units and light pulse receiving units adjacent associated light pulse deflecting devices may be mounted adjacent the edge surfaces of a display unit or an LCD unit and also in that the touch screen can thereby be given a particularly thin design with low energy consumption and a limited power input.

More particularly the invention makes possible clear evaluation of a small chosen surface section of a small display surface with the aid of the front surface part of a thumb said surface part covering a surface section that greatly exceeds the small chosen surface section.

The primary characteristic features of the present invention are set forth in the characterising clause of the accompanying claim .

It is pointed out initially that we have chosen to use in the following description of embodiments at present preferred and including significant characteristic features of the invention and illustrated in the figures of the accompanying drawings special terms and terminology with the intention of illustrating the inventive concept more clearly.

However it will be noted that the expressions chosen here shall not be seen as limited solely to the chosen terms used in the description but that each term chosen shall be interpreted as also including all technical equivalents that function in the same or at least essentially the same way so as to achieve the same or essentially the same intention and or technical effect.

Thus is a perspective exploded view of a mobile telephone apparatus T whose casing parts enclose a touch screen arrangement that rests on a supportive substrate among other things.

The supportive substrate of the illustrated embodiment has the form of a printed circuit board or a circuit board of known design.

Although not shown the substrate may include edges that are raised from a display unit in the form of a known LCD unit.

It is obvious that the basic principles of the present invention can be implemented solely with the use of rows or columns of light pulse emitting units and oppositely located rows or columns of light pulse receiving units with respective associated circuits and at least with respect to the activation of certain functions.

It will be understood from the following description of the illustrated embodiment that the touch screen belonging to the mobile telephone T is built around the display unit with a number of light pulse emitting units orientated at right angles and a number of light pulse receiving units orientated at right angles said units being edge related and surrounding said display unit resting on the substrate .

For the sake of simplicity requisite devices and connections to the substrate and requisite functions for driving the LCD unit in a known manner are not shown.

The units that emit pairs of mutually intersecting light pulses are adapted to emit short IR light pulses through the medium of pulse generating circuits . One such IR light pulse is referenced in where it is shown orientated at a very small distance over the upper surface of the display unit .

In the illustrated embodiment this graphic display is chosen to comply with a chosen menu of a mobile telephone apparatus T.

Although these graphic symbols are shown to consist of digits orientated in rows and columns in the case of the illustrated embodiment it will be understood that a display unit in the form of an LCD unit can be caused to present a number of other symbols such as digits letters words sentences or corresponding graphic symbols depending on the menu chosen.

A number of pulse emitting units in right angle orientation are adapted to emit light pulses via the control from coordinated pulse generating circuits said column related pulse emitting units being referenced I J K . . . R S while the row related units have been referenced H G F . . . B A.

The pulse receiving circuits are of a known kind and each circuit is adapted to generate current pulses or voltage pulses corresponding to the light pulses that are received by corresponding light pulse receiving units and to transpose these pulses into signal information sent to a calculating unit .

More specifically the calculating unit shown in functions to activate each of the row orientated units H to A and each of the column orientated units I to S in a chosen order and at the same time open the oppositely located pulse receiving circuits and

This means that when the calculating unit activates a light pulse emitting unit P during a time slot the calculating unit will expect said light pulse to be detected by the light pulse receiving unit L during the same time slot.

In such case the calculating unit allows associated calculating circuits such as circuit to take an inactive state.

On the other hand if the expected light pulse fails to arrive e.g. is shadowed by a pointer the calculating circuit is activated.

The calculating unit thus includes a plurality of calculating circuits of which a calculating circuit is adapted to allow the geographic position of the point P and its related row to be evaluated depending on the position and the row or column of one or more co ordinate orientated light pulse receiving column related units S I one of which is referenced P in in connection with the circuits and therewith activate a function that corresponds to this position in a chosen menu via a function related output signal generated on a conductor

An output signal of this kind is of course more complex than solely an output signal. Despite this the output signal is not shown for the sake of simplicity.

The calculation performed in the calculating circuit can be performed more precisely in order to be able to establish the two co ordinates of a chosen geographical position of the point P. This calculation can be based on the orientation of the light pulse receiving unit C and its connection to circuit C by taking into account also the light pulse receiving unit P which receives no light pulse or which indicates a light pulse deficiency meaning in practice that both units C and P are shadowed by one single pointer placed at the point or surface section P.

The calculating unit includes a further calculating circuit that keeps an account of the activation of and the sequence assigned to respective circuits within the coordinations and respectively and a light pulse emission from each of the column related units I S and the row related units H to A respectively and emission dependent activation of the individual circuits within the co ordinations and respectively and an anticipated reception of a light pulse in each of the units S I and A H respectively within their allotted time slots.

On the basis of information as to which of the units S I and the units A H should indicate the presence of a light pulse within its time slot but fails to do so it is possible to evaluate a position that is representative of the two dimensional geographic position P on the upper surface of the display unit where mutually intersecting light rays from the light pulse emitting unit L on the one hand and the light pulse from the light pulse emitting unit F on the other hand via respective circuits L and F is shadowed by a narrow pointer in point P whereby solely those light pulse receiving units P and C in connection with said circuits P and C are shadowed which is thus read in the calculating circuit and causes activation of the calculating circuit

Returning to it will be seen that the light pulse emitting units such as the unit L and the light pulse receiving units such as the unit P shall be orientated adjacent said display unit with the directions of respective light pulses and from the pulse emitting and pulse receiving units are at right angles or at least generally at right angles to a plane orientated to coincide with the planar upper surface of the display unit .

The invention also relates to the use of at least two pairs of mutually opposite light pulse deflecting devices and in practice four pairs of such devices said devices being positioned very close to the display unit and around the edges of said unit in accordance with the illustration.

It will also be seen that the supporting substrate shall not only support a display unit but also the series orientated light pulse emitting units and the series orientated light pulse receiving units in the form of a plurality of row related light pulse emitting and mutually identical units and a plurality of row orientated light pulse receiving and mutually identical units in mutually equal numbers on both sides of the display unit for direct correspondence with each other.

The supportive substrate may consist of the telephone circuit board carrying discrete components not shown .

The substrate is thus not only adapted to support the display unit centrally thereon but also edge related light pulse emitting units and the oppositely located light pulse receiving units disposed around all four edges of the substrate and also the four mutually opposite devices and respectively.

The units emitting said mutually crossing light pulses and said units receiving said mutually crossing light pulses may conveniently be connected to said pulse generating circuits and said pulse receiving circuits by means of connecting wires or the like not shown said circuits conveniently being attached to or included as components in the circuit board .

As will be seen particularly from the light pulse deflecting devices may each consist of a mirror unit that has an angled mirror surface where in such case the mirror surfaces of said mirror units will preferably be orientated at an angle of 45 degrees in relation to a vertical direction of propagation allocated to the light pulses to a horizontal direction of propagation over the upper surface of the display unit .

However shows that each light pulse deflecting device shall consist of a three sided right angled prism formed unit where respective mirror surfaces and of said prism units will obtain the orientation disclosed in the introduction and extend along two rows and two columns of the units and .

The circuit board may also carry electronic circuits and components adapted to perform functions related to a mobile telephone unit and a telephone network to which said unit is connected.

Thus said units are orientated directly in opposing columns and rows with right angled orientations there between and at a distance between said rows and columns that only slightly exceeds the dimensions of the display unit as made evident in .

As shown in the light pulse emitting units such as the unit L and the light pulse receiving units such as the unit P are positioned on the sides of the display unit and closely adjacent the mutually opposite edges of said display unit so as to provide a compact construction.

As will be seen from the substrate in the form of a circuit board carrying inter al a display unit light pulses emitting units light pulse receiving units and fixed components necessary to the function of the mobile telephone unit T is adapted for fastening to a first casing part of the telephone unit T intended for co action with a second casing part . The mutually co acting state of said casing parts is shown in .

The light pulse deflecting devices with their respective mirror surfaces and the light pulse deflecting devices with their mirror surfaces are disposed along a rectangular raised edge or rim included in the second casing part as a replaceable lid or cover where said rim is able to co act with and completely cover an opening with a transparent protective element such as a plastic sheet or glass sheet positioned immediately above the display surface

In accordance with the illustration the calculating unit is thereby able to ascertain that light pulses have been emitted within one and the same time slot not only by the unit L but also by the unit F and that no light pulse has been received either in the unit P or in the unit C within said time slot thereby enabling the geographic two dimensional position of P to be calculated and evaluated and therewith enabling corresponding information to be sent to the circuit board via the conductor

The surface section is represented by the number and the display unit has been allocated a first display surface section represented by the keypad of the mobile telephone apparatus T with its rows and columns of keys or buttons and a second display surface section represented by the presentation surface of said mobile telephone apparatus T.

Thus the possibility of coordinating both the first display surface section and the second display surface section within one and the same display unit lies within the concept of the invention.

It should be noted in this respect with reference to that a marked surface section such as a number presenting surface section may be diffuse and cover two or more light pulse receiving units for instance units B C D and E and four light pulse receiving units Q P O and N active against opposing light pulse emitting units G F E D and K L M N respectively and that a correct indication may also be obtained even though all of said receivers indicate the absence of light pulse related signals or shadows within their respective time slots.

In this case the calculating unit is able to sort out peripheral units in the present case the units Q N and B E respectively with the aid of a calculating circuit and therewith deliver a clearer evaluation of the position P via the units P O and C D in accordance with the spot markings in .

As a result of this pulse structure each of the light pulse emitting and angled units and respectively will be actuated solely for a short period of time and within an allocated time slot.

During the short time slot t t in which a light pulse emitting unit such as the unit L is actuated the calculating unit ascertains via an associated pulse receiving circuit P whether or not a light pulse has been received on an oppositely located receiver P. The time point for said evaluation is referenced t.

Immediately after the status of the receiver P has been read the light pulse emitting unit L concerned is extinguished at the end of a time slot t t.

Disturbances that may be caused from ambient light can be suppressed by temporarily increasing the intensity of each of the selected light pulse emitting units .

Thus as will be seen from in combination with in respect of conditions where two or more side related light pulse receiving units Q P O N and associated pulse receiving circuits indicate simultaneously the absence of light pulses the calculating unit functions with the aid of internal calculating circuits such as circuit to interpret this information to mean that the intended geographical position P shall be considered to be located between the points or consist of the most probable points that are representative via said corresponding pulse receiving circuits.

Thus shows that each light pulse emitting unit shall be ignited over only a short time slot or pulse time e.g. 10 s with an electric current higher than 1 A with a subsequent pause to a time point t which may be adapted to more than 100 times the chosen pulse time t t.

Also shown in is that the emission time or time slot t t for the unit L begins t slightly before the activated reception time t for the unit P and that an idling time t t is caused to lapse prior to activation of an adjacent unit K within its time slot where after the unit Q is immediately activated.

The same applies to the unit J and to the unit R and also remaining units these latter units not being shown in .

With the intention of saving energy a lower idling time frequency t t can be chosen and only one unit L used. When the light pulse is broken the display unit is activated via a circuit in accordance with the pulse plan.

The light pulse emitting units are activated via associated pulse generating circuits sequentially in a consecutive order or are selectively positioned in a predetermined order and the corresponding light pulse detecting units can also be activated in said predetermined order via the circuits 

Although not shown it is obvious that a plurality of light pulse receiving units P Q R could be adapted to receive consecutively during a chosen time duration a plurality of light pulses emitted in time slots from solely one light pulse emitting unit for instance the unit L and to adapt the light pulse receiving units to be activated to receive anticipated light pulses during said chosen time duration and therewith allow occurring light pulses and shadowed light pulses to be registered.

In this case the display unit with its upper surface is actuated by a surface section of the thumb of the user namely the thumb surface that faces inwards towards the palm of the user s hand said surface therewith covering a large part of the surface section of the upper surface

In this regard shows that the surface section of the thumb will shadow the column related units R Q P and O and also the row related units C D E F and G and that the calculating circuit functions to establish the key or button that has been actuated from this pattern of shadowed light pulses.

In this respect shows that the surface section of the thumb will shadow the column related units S R and Q and also the row related units D to H and that the calculating circuit is adapted to establish which button or key has been actuated from the pattern of shadowed light pulses.

The pulse technique enables stronger or weaker signals to be generated with the aid of a calculating circuit so as to allow energy consumption and power output to be adapted to special ambient circumstances such as sunlight or darkish surroundings.

Because the light pulse emitting units are ignited during a time slot of short duration these units can be overloaded for higher light intensities without being destroyed.

In the case of a touch screen constructed in accordance with the invention it is solely the optical positioning P that is measured no pressure requirement thereby enabling movement of the thumb along the upper surface of the display unit to be determined in a calculating circuit such as determination of a sign or activation of a telephone function.

For example the thumb may be moved in a direction from right to left so as to activate the finish close function.

By setting conditions for what shall be estimated as the measured position P the technique can be readily applied with a small display restricted to said surface as a keyboard.

Because no functional component is required over the display unit there can be used a conventional plastic cover that can be changed when scratched.

The calculating unit need not necessarily be adapted to calculate a centre of the pointer e.g. of the thumb . It may at times be convenient to allow the outermost edge or outermost edges of the covered surface section to be read.

As will be evident from orientation of the position P can be derived by the units B and H indicating light pulses whereby the unit can be E considered the most likely in this regard.

The position P is derived from the fact that the unit does not indicate light pulses but that the unit N does so.

This is interpreted as meaning that the key or button located at a corresponding height shall be activated.

Correspondingly shows that the orientation of position P can be determined by ascertaining that the row related units D H and the column related units S R and Q are extinguished.

This can be interpreted by the calculating unit as meaning that the key or button located on a row or at a height shall be activated.

The calculating unit also provides a switch between an inactive state and an active state wherein the inactive state provides a light pulse frequency of about 10 Hz while the active state provides a time slot of 5 26 s.

A time circuit provides an automatic switch between these states or functions such that a switch to the inactive state is carried out in the event of a waiting time of 2 5 sec. after an active state and in the absence of any actuation.

It will be understood that the invention is not restricted to the afore described exemplifying embodiments thereof and that modifications can be made within the scope of the inventive concept illustrated in the accompanying Claims.
