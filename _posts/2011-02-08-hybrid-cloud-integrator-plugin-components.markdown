title: Hybrid cloud integrator plug-in components
abstract: Integrating data processing resources across a hybrid cloud includes providing a plug-in software component configured to be installed in a software framework. When the plug-in software component is activated, it may generate an interface for a consumer of data processing resources. Using this interface, the consumer of data processing resources may request the use of data processing resources provided as a service on the hybrid cloud. In response, the plug-in software component may acquire the requested data processing resources via interfaces provided by the various data processing resources. A number of different data processing resources may have different interface requirements. However, the first interface generated by the plug-in software component may provide a single vendor neutral interface for accessing data processing resources on the hybrid cloud by the consumer of data processing resources.

The disclosure relates generally to data processing systems and methods and more specifically to systems and methods for using data processing resources provided as a service known as cloud computing.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. For example cloud computing allows a consumer to obtain data processing resources such as networks network bandwidth servers processing memory storage applications virtual machines and services as a service on a temporary basis when needed. Several vendors are currently offering various cloud services. For example such services include infrastructure as a service platform as a service storage as a service software as a service and business process as a service cloud services. These services use vendor specific service request access and consumption models.

A consumer of cloud computing services may have its own data processing system resources. For example the consumer may be a business or other entity. The consumer may have invested in its own data processing system resources. These resources may include a computer network. The consumer s computer network provides a limited amount of processing capability and data storage resources. The consumer s computer network also provides specific data processing applications. The consumer s computer network may be located on premise and may be operated as a private cloud.

At certain times the consumer may require data processing resources beyond those available in its computer network. For example at certain times the demand for data processing resources may outstrip the capability of the consumer s computer network. At these times the response time of the consumer s computer network for some applications may increase to unacceptable levels. At other times the consumer may require data processing applications that are not available on the consumer s own computer network. For example the consumer may require at times the use of data processing applications that are not part of the consumer s core competency.

At those times when the consumer requires data processing resources beyond its own the consumer may purchase such resources as a service on a temporary basis from a provider of cloud computing services. For example the consumer may obtain additional processing or storage resources or specific application functionality as a service on a temporary basis from the cloud computing provider s data processing resources. Different types of service offerings may provide parts of the solution used in processing the consumer s workload. The provider s available data processing resources is known as a public cloud.

The consumer typically continues to operate its own computer network while some data processing resources are being obtained from a public cloud. Thus data processing resources from the public cloud typically are obtained in order to supplement the data processing resources of the consumer s own private cloud at certain times of need. The simultaneous and coordinated operation of data processing resources from multiple clouds may be referred to as hybrid cloud computing. For example operation of the consumer s private cloud along with resources obtained from one or more public clouds is a specific example of hybrid cloud computing.

According to one illustrative embodiment a computer program product for integrating data processing resources is provided. The computer program product includes program instructions stored on a computer readable storage medium. The program instructions form a plug in software component configured to be installed in a software framework. The program instructions include program instructions to provide a first interface for a consumer of data processing resources and program instructions to communicate with first data processing resources via data processing resource interfaces of the first data processing resources. The first data processing resources are provided as a service. The program instructions also include program instructions to use the first data processing resources for the consumer of data processing resources via the data processing resource interfaces responsive to a communication from the consumer of data processing resources via the first interface.

According to another illustrative embodiment a method for integrating data processing resources is provided. A first interface for a consumer of data processing resources is generated. A request from a consumer of data processing resources to acquire first data processing resources is received via the first interface. The first data processing resources are provided as a service. Responsive to receiving the request the first data processing resources are acquired for the consumer of data processing resources via data processing resource interfaces of the first data processing resources.

According to yet another illustrative embodiment an apparatus for integrating data processing resources is provided. The apparatus comprises a data processing system configured to install a plug in software component in a software framework to use the plug in software component to generate a first interface for a consumer of data processing resources to receive via the first interface a request from a consumer of data processing resources to use first data processing resources and to use the plug in software component to acquire the first data processing resources for use by the consumer of data processing resources via data processing resource interfaces of the first data processing resources responsive to receiving the request from the consumer of data processing resources. The first data processing resources are provided as a service.

Other objects features and advantages of the illustrative embodiments will be apparent from the following detailed description taken in consideration with the attached drawing figures.

It is understood in advance that although this disclosure includes a detailed description on cloud computing implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather the illustrative embodiments are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed.

For convenience the detailed description includes the following definitions which have been derived from the Draft NIST Working Definition of Cloud Computing by Peter Mell and Tim Grance dated Oct. 7 2009.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks network bandwidth servers processing memory storage applications virtual machines and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics at least three service models and at least four deployment models.

On demand self service a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service s provider.

Broad network access capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms e.g. mobile phones laptops and PDAs .

Resource pooling the provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction e.g. country state or datacenter .

Rapid elasticity capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned in some cases automatically to quickly scale out and rapidly release to quickly scale in. To the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.

Measured service cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service e.g. storage processing bandwidth and active user accounts . Resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Software as a Service SaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser e.g. web based e mail . The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings.

Platform as a Service PaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or consumer acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.

Infrastructure as a Service IaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing storage networks and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components e.g. host firewalls .

Private cloud the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Community cloud the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns e.g. mission security requirements policy and compliance considerations . It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Public cloud the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.

Hybrid cloud the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds private community or public that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability e.g. cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds and service interoperability.

A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness low coupling modularity and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure comprising a network of interconnected nodes.

Computer system server may be described in the general context of computer system executable instructions such as program modules being executed by a computer system. Generally program modules may include routines programs objects components logic data structures and so on that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer system server may be practiced in distributed cloud computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed cloud computing environment program modules may be located in both local and remote computer system storage media including memory storage devices.

As shown in computer system server in cloud computing node is shown in the form of a general purpose computing device. The components of computer system server may include but are not limited to one or more processors or processor unit system memory and bus that couples various system components including system memory to processor unit .

Processor unit executes instructions for software that may be loaded into system memory . Processor unit may be a number of processors a multi processor core or some other type of processor depending on the particular implementation. A number as used herein with reference to an item means one or more items. Further processor unit may be implemented using a number of heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example processor unit may be a symmetric multi processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.

Bus represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller a peripheral bus an accelerated graphics port and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures.

Computer system server typically includes a variety of computer system readable media. Such media may be any available media that is accessible by computer system server and it includes both volatile media non volatile media removable media and non removable media.

System memory can include computer system readable media in the form of volatile memory such as random access memory RAM and or cache memory . Computer system server may further include other removable non removable and volatile non volatile computer system storage media. By way of example only storage system can be provided for reading from and writing to a non removable non volatile magnetic media not shown and typically called a hard drive . Although not shown a magnetic disk drive for reading from and writing to a removable non volatile magnetic disk e.g. a floppy disk and an optical disk drive for reading from or writing to a removable non volatile optical disk such as a CD ROM DVD ROM or other optical media can be provided. In such instances each can be connected to bus by one or more data media interfaces. As will be further depicted and described below memory may include at least one program product having a set e.g. at least one of program modules that are configured to carry out the functions of embodiments of the illustrative embodiments.

Each of the operating systems one or more application programs other program modules and program data or some combination thereof may include an implementation of a networking environment. Program modules generally carry out the functions and or methodologies of the illustrative embodiments as described herein.

Computer system server may also communicate with one or more external devices such as a keyboard a pointing device display etc. one or more devices that enable a user to interact with computer system server and or any devices e.g. network card modem etc. that enable computer system server to communicate with one or more other computing devices. Such communication can occur via I O interfaces . Still yet computer system server can communicate with one or more networks such as a local area network LAN a general wide area network WAN and or a public network e.g. the Internet via network adapter . As depicted network adapter communicates with the other components of computer system server via bus . It should be understood that although not shown other hardware and or software components could be used in conjunction with computer system server . Examples include but are not limited to microcode device drivers redundant processing units external disk drive arrays RAID systems tape drives and data archival storage systems etc.

Referring now to an illustration of a cloud computing environment is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. In this illustrative example cloud computing environment comprises one or more cloud computing nodes with which local computing devices used by cloud consumers may communicate. For example cloud computing node in is one example of cloud computing nodes . Local computing devices which may communicate with cloud computing nodes may include for example personal digital assistant PDA or cellular telephone A desktop computer B laptop computer C and or automobile computer system N. Cloud computing nodes may communicate with one another. They may be grouped not shown physically or virtually in one or more networks such as private community public or hybrid clouds as described hereinabove or a combination thereof. This allows cloud computing environment to offer infrastructure platforms and or software as services for which a cloud consumer does not need to maintain resources on a local computing device. It is understood that the types of computing devices A B C and N shown in are intended to be illustrative only and that cloud computing nodes and cloud computing environment can communicate with any type of computerized device over any type of network and or network addressable connection e.g. using a web browser . Program code located on one of cloud computing nodes may be stored on a computer recordable storage medium in one of cloud computing nodes and downloaded to a computing device within computing devices A B C and N over a network for use in these computing devices. For example a server computer in cloud computing nodes may store program code on a computer readable storage medium on the server computer. The server computer may download the program code to a client computer in computing devices A B C and N for use on the client computer.

Referring now to a set of functional abstraction layers is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.

Examples of workloads and functions which may be provided from this layer include mapping and navigation software development and lifecycle management virtual classroom education delivery data analytics processing transaction processing and resource monitoring and management processing.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account a number of different considerations. For example the different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that many enterprises have an existing investment in information technology resources. These enterprises want to use their existing infrastructure software and management resources. Such enterprises at times also may want to augment their own data processing resources selectively with cloud based services. Thus for economic and functional reasons there may be a need to use on premise enterprise infrastructure platform applications or data and off premise cloud service infrastructure platform applications or data in an integrated manner.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that in cases of cloud computing server network data and applications used in processing the enterprise workload may reside within an enterprise datacenter may be with partners of the enterprise or may reside over the Internet in a public cloud. Thus processing a workload using a combination of on premise enterprise resources and public cloud resources involves using some of the on premise infrastructure platform applications or data as well as some off premise cloud based services and data. Cloud computing solutions of this type may create integration interoperability and management problems.

For example the different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that cloud computing consumers desire to maintain a seamless interface across on premise and off premise cloud boundaries. However the governing policies for cloud operation and security related procedures always need to be in place. These competing requirements create the need for an integrated infrastructure and management solution that can span across the consumer datacenter and into one or more public cloud environments.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that easy access to public cloud services allows such services to be consumed within an enterprise in a non centralized and unmanaged manner. De centralizing and moving data processing resources to off site vendors increases the complexity and time required to support them. Typically this complexity is only evident when the cloud resources being consumed are reported to the enterprise information technology department. Security and system governance lapses may result from this lack of management. Regulatory and business compliance may require policy based data sharing across a hybrid cloud. However current unmanaged methods for accessing cloud service resources cannot guarantee such compliance.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that policy based workload management across a hybrid cloud and automated support of cloud computing services will reduce information technology costs. Such hybrid cloud management and support will improve security and compliance and thereby will increase enterprise adoption of cloud technologies.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account the desirability of a vender neutral and service specific interface to all clouds that provide a desired cloud service. The different illustrative embodiments also recognize and take into account the desirability of controlling cloud vendor selection based on business conditions.

A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment provides for integration of on premise infrastructure platform applications and data with public cloud based infrastructure platform services and data. A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to extend on premise datacenter capabilities by augmenting such capabilities with data processing capabilities provided in a public cloud. For example such cloud based capabilities may include infrastructure as a service or storage as a service capabilities. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment the desired solution for processing a workload may be implemented in a hybrid cloud environment that integrates multiple private cloud and public cloud based services.

A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to extend the reach of a consumer s on premise data processing management functionality to manage the data processing resource capabilities extended in a public cloud. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a hybrid cloud computing environment including both private cloud and public cloud based services may be managed in a more effective manner as a single logical cloud of resources. Hybrid cloud integration in accordance with an illustrative embodiment allows policy based integration of infrastructure services and data across the hybrid cloud. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment management of the integrated infrastructure and services can be performed in a centralized manner. In this way workload specific actions can be taken consistently and in a vendor neutral manner even if the components of the workload are processed using multiple cloud based services.

A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may comprise a hybrid cloud integration framework. Hybrid cloud integration components may be plugged in to the hybrid cloud integration framework as needed in a systematic manner.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that current cloud based services accessible over the internet are provided by multiple vendors. Multiple vendors offer directly competing services. For example both IBM SBDTC and Amazon EC2 offer infrastructure as a service cloud services. Different protocols and application programming interfaces are required for interfacing with these competing services. Currently consumers of these services have to develop and maintain vendor specific code to access the same service from different vendors. Consumers of cloud computing services would prefer to maintain a single vendor neutral and service specific interface to all clouds that provide a desired service. Consumers also desire to control vendor selection based on business considerations.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a cloud service broker may be provided as a plug in for a hybrid cloud integrator. The cloud service broker provides a single vendor neutral interface for provisioning resources from multiple clouds for use by a consumer of data processing resources. Knowledge of the protocols and application programming interfaces required for interfacing with competing services is made invisible to the consumer accessing cloud resources via the cloud service broker. The cloud service broker also may implement policies for controlling cloud service vendor selection based on business considerations.

Referring now to a block diagram of a data processing environment employing hybrid cloud integration is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Data processing environment includes consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . In some embodiments provider data processing resources may be referred to as first data processing resources and consumer data processing resources may be referred to as second data processing resources or vice versa.

Consumer data processing resources may include data processing resources that are owned or controlled exclusively by consumer of data processing resources . For example consumer of data processing resources may be a business entity or other organization or enterprise that uses consumer data processing resources to process consumer processed consumer workload .

Consumer data processing resources may include any combination of data processing systems and devices for processing consumer processed consumer workload . For example consumer data processing resources may include any combination of data processing infrastructure networks processors data storage databases and applications.

Consumer data processing resources may include or may be referred to as private cloud . Consumer data processing resources may include data processing resources that are located on premise or may be referred to as being on premise . In this case on premise may mean that all of consumer data processing resources are co located in a single location that is owned or controlled by consumer of data processing resources that also owns or controls consumer data processing resources . Alternatively on premise may mean that consumer data processing resources are under the control of consumer of data processing resources for exclusive use by consumer of data processing resources even though some or all of consumer data processing resources are physically located in a number of remote locations.

Provider data processing resources are data processing resources that are available to be shared by a number of consumers of data processing resources including consumer of data processing resources . Provider data processing resources may include any combination of data processing systems or devices. For example provider data processing resources may include any combination of data processing infrastructure networks processors data storage or applications.

Provider data processing resources may be provided as services . For example provider data processing resources may be provided as services by public cloud . Public cloud makes provider data processing resources available to consumer of data processing resources as services . For example services may include one or more of infrastructure as a service platform as a service software as a service or other data processing related services.

At certain times consumer of data processing resources may use provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload . Provider processed consumer workload typically is a portion of the entire consumer workload that consumer of data processing resources needs to be processed. In some cases provider processed consumer workload may be the entire consumer workload that consumer of data processing resources needs to be processed. For example consumer of data processing resources may use provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload when consumer data processing resources are overloaded processing consumer processed consumer workload . At other times consumer of data processing resources may employ provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload when processing of provider processed consumer workload is not one of the core competencies of consumer of data processing resources . As another example consumer of data processing resources may use provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload when particular applications required to process provider processed consumer workload are not available among consumer data processing resources . In any case processing of provider processed consumer workload using provider data processing resources may require that a number of applications or data or both applications and data be provided to provider data processing resources in order to process provider processed consumer workload .

Thus at times the entire consumer workload being processed by or for consumer of data processing resources may be processed in part as consumer processed consumer workload on consumer data processing resources such as private cloud and in part as provider processed consumer workload on provider data processing resources such as public cloud . In this case the integration of private cloud and public cloud to process consumer workload for consumer of data processing resources forms hybrid cloud .

Operation of hybrid cloud requires communication between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . However security concerns may require the prevention of unauthorized access to consumer data processing resources from provider data processing resources or from any other unauthorized sources. Therefore firewall may be provided between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Firewall is designed to block unauthorized access to consumer data processing resources by provider data processing resources or by any other resources on the internet while permitting authorized communications between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Firewall may be implemented in either hardware or software or using a combination of both hardware and software. For example without limitation firewall may be implemented in consumer data processing resources .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator provides integration across consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources to implement integrated data processing resources forming hybrid cloud . For example without limitation hybrid cloud integrator may be implemented by consumer of data processing resources on consumer data processing resources .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator includes framework integration platform and number of plug ins . For example framework may be implemented in software as a software framework. Framework may be implemented on integration platform . Integration platform provides the underlying hardware and software required to implement hybrid cloud integrator . For example integration platform may include the hardware operating system and runtime environment in which hybrid cloud integrator is implemented.

Framework provides plug in interface . Plug in interface allows number of plug ins to be installed in hybrid cloud integrator . Plug ins are software components that are configured to provide functionality for integrated use of consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Plug ins may include for example number of service deployment and integration components number of data integration components and number of management integration components .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment service deployment and integration components may be used by consumer of data processing resources to deploy services in provider data processing resources that are needed to process provider processed consumer workload . Service deployment and integration components also may be used to integrate services deployed in provider data processing resources with consumer data processing resources to provide integrated data processing resources to process consumer workload .

Data integration components may be used by consumer of data processing resources to migrate replicate transform and integrate data used in processing consumer workload between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Service deployment and integration components and data integration components may be used to enforce workload and data specific deployment and integration policies specified by consumer of data processing resources .

Management integration components may include any components that may be used by consumer of data processing resources to monitor and manage the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources . For example management integration components may include monitoring integration components. Monitoring integration components may be used by consumer of data processing resources to monitor the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources in order to manage such processing. Management integration components may also or alternatively include metering components or secure connectivity management components or other management related components.

The operating characteristics of plug ins are defined by configuration data . In accordance with an illustrative embodiment framework provides service connectivity management function . Service connectivity management function allows current configuration data from plug ins and other information about plug ins to be made available to a user on user interface . Service connectivity management function also allows configuration data to be received from user interface for plug ins . Thus service connectivity management function provides a connection between plug ins and user interface allowing users to view and change the operating configuration of plug ins via user interface .

Framework also provides runtime management function . Runtime management function provides for managing operation of plug ins during operation thereof. Specifically runtime management function may provide for activating plug ins and for controlling operation of plug ins after plug ins are activated.

Framework also may provide for communication between plug ins . Communication between plug ins allows plug ins to interact with each other. For example communication between plug ins allows one of plug ins to access and make use of the functionality provided by another of plug ins in framework .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator provides flexible and reliable automated integration of data processing resources to process a workload. For example hybrid cloud integrator may be used by workload manager to access provider data processing resources automatically when needed to supplement consumer data processing resources . Hybrid cloud integrator also may be used by workload manager to monitor the operation of provider data processing resources while processing provider processed consumer workload .

Workload manager provides automated workload management . Automated workload management includes automatically managing workload processing on available data processing resources. An example of a system that provides this type of automated workload management is the IBM Tivoli Service Automation Manager TSAM available from International Business Machines Corporation. Illustrative embodiments may be used however in combination with any currently available workload manager providing automated workload management functions or with any workload manager that may become available in the future. Illustrative embodiment also may be used in combination with workload managers in which automated workload management functions are implemented in combination with a human operator.

Workload manager may provide automated workload management based on policies . Policies define the limiting parameters under which workload manager may use available data processing resources. For example policies may define when or under what conditions workload manager may use provider data processing resources to process consumer workload . Policies also may specify which specific provider data processing resources may be used to process consumer workload . Policies also may specify consumer data that may be replicated and accessed by provider data processing resources and the portion of consumer workload that may be processed by provider data processing resources . Policies may specify security and privacy constraints that must be applied for processing consumer workload by provider data processing resources .

Policies may be developed using business rules management engine . Business rules management engine may take into consideration a variety of business related and other factors to determine policies . For example factors used by business rules management engine to determine policies may include financial security compliance and customer relations factors or others.

Workload manager may provide automatic policy based provisioning based on policies . For example policy based provisioning may call for the provisioning of provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload . In this case workload manager may use hybrid cloud integrator to deploy provider data processing resources needed to process provider processed consumer workload . For example service deployment and integration components may be used to deploy services in public cloud that are needed to process provider processed consumer workload . Service deployment and integration components may establish communication with provider data processing resources through firewall . For example such communication may be established via application programming interface portal in public cloud . Applications data or both applications and data needed for processing provider processed consumer workload may be provided to provider data processing resources by workload manager via hybrid cloud integrator .

Hybrid cloud integrator also may be used to establish workload processing image in public cloud . Workload processing image pre defines services needed to process provider processed consumer workload . By establishing workload processing image in advance provider data processing resources needed to process provider processed consumer workload may be deployed more rapidly when workload manager determines that provider data processing resources will be used for this purpose.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator allows workload manager to access provider data processing resources as easily as consumer data processing resources . Plug ins in hybrid cloud integrator handle all of the special requirements of provider data processing resources needed to access those resources.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator also provides for monitoring and management of the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources . For example service deployment and integration components may be used to deploy services in public cloud to implement provider processing monitoring agent . Provider processing monitoring agent collects data for monitoring the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources . Similarly consumer processing monitoring agent may be implemented in consumer data processing resources . Consumer processing monitoring agent collects data for monitoring the processing of consumer processed consumer workload by consumer data processing resources .

Data from consumer processing monitoring agent may be provided to monitoring infrastructure . Monitoring infrastructure may be implemented in consumer data processing resources . Due to the security provided by firewall provider processing monitoring agent may not be allowed to push data to monitoring infrastructure on the other side of firewall . In accordance with an illustrative embodiment during runtime monitoring components that are part of management integration components installed in hybrid cloud integrator may activate provider side monitoring gateway in provider data processing resources . Provider side monitoring gateway may be deployed in provider data processing resources using service deployment and integration components installed in hybrid cloud integrator . Data from provider processing monitoring agent is provided to provider side monitoring gateway . Monitoring components in hybrid cloud integrator may retrieve the monitored data from provider side monitoring gateway via a connection. The monitoring components in hybrid cloud integrator then may provide the monitored data from the provider side of hybrid cloud to monitoring infrastructure . From the point of view of monitoring infrastructure the monitoring components in hybrid cloud integrator provide monitored data for provider side services in the same manner as consumer processing monitoring agent provides monitored data for consumer data processing resources .

Connection between hybrid cloud integrator and provider side monitoring gateway may be implemented using a hybrid cloud monitoring plug in in hybrid cloud integrator . For example the hybrid cloud monitoring plug in may be one of management integration components in hybrid cloud integrator . The monitoring plug in may enable hybrid cloud monitoring by setting up and configuring provider side monitoring gateway and consumer side monitoring gateway . For example consumer side monitoring gateway may be implemented in hybrid cloud integrator on the consumer side of hybrid cloud . Consumer side monitoring gateway connects to provider side monitoring gateway negotiating firewall . Consumer side monitoring gateway also connects with monitoring infrastructure in consumer data processing resources . Using the connection from hybrid cloud integrator to provider side monitoring gateway consumer side monitoring gateway may pull monitored data for provider data processing resources that is collected by provider side monitoring gateway across firewall and then push the data to consumer side monitoring infrastructure .

In one embodiment as just described the connection between hybrid cloud integrator is implemented via hybrid cloud integrator to provide access through firewall to information for monitoring the processing of provider processed consumer workload in public cloud by monitoring infrastructure . In other embodiments the connection between hybrid cloud integrator may be implemented separately from hybrid cloud integrator . For example using a virtual private network a secure connection may be established between monitoring infrastructure and provider data processing resources processing provider processed consumer workload in public cloud to implement a connection through firewall without using the resources of hybrid cloud integrator .

Monitoring infrastructure thus may receive monitoring information for provider data processing resources that is obtained by provider processing monitoring agent and monitoring information from consumer processing monitoring agent for consumer data processing resources . Monitoring infrastructure may process the received monitoring information to generate an integrated display of workload processing conditions for provider data processing resources and consumer data processing resources . This integrated display may be presented to a user such as a system administrator on monitoring station . Thus in accordance with an illustrative embodiment a display of workload processing conditions across hybrid cloud may be presented to a user in an integrated manner. Such an integrated display allows a user to monitor and manage workload processing across hybrid cloud in an integrated effective and efficient manner.

Monitoring infrastructure also may look for and detect the occurrence of events from the monitoring information provided by provider processing monitoring agent and consumer processing monitoring agent . Events may be defined by the occurrence of specified conditions or patterns in the monitored data. For example monitored data exceeding a defined threshold for at least a specified time period may indicate the occurrence of one of events . In accordance with an illustrative embodiment events may be defined by the occurrence of any condition state or pattern of interest in the monitored data provided by provider processing monitoring agent and consumer processing monitoring agent .

Events may be provided as input to event correlation and aggregation function . Event correlation and aggregation function may provide and may be referred to as an event correlation service. Event correlation and aggregation function may aggregate and correlate events over periods of time. Event correlation and aggregation function may determine whether the aggregated and correlated events indicate the presence of data processing conditions that should be or may be addressed to maintain or improve system performance. For example event correlation and aggregation function may determine that a series of detected events has occurred indicating that consumer data processing resources or provider data processing resources are overloaded. Similarly event correlation and aggregation function may determine that a series of detected events has occurred indicating that consumer data processing resources or provider data processing resources are being underutilized. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment any data processing condition of interest that may be defined by aggregated or correlated events may be detected by event correlation and aggregation function .

In response to a determination by event correlation and aggregation function that a data processing condition of interest exists service desk ticketing function may send event based service request to workload manager . For example service desk ticketing function may generate event based service request in response to a determination by event correlation and aggregation function that a data processing condition exists that should be or may be addressed to maintain or improve system performance. Event based service request may indicate to workload manager the particular condition that has been determined to exist. In this case workload manager may determine the appropriate action to take in response to the indicated condition. Alternatively service desk ticketing function may determine the action that needs to be taken in response to a particular condition that has been determined to exist. In this case event based service request may indicate to workload manager the action that is being requested.

In any case workload manager may determine whether or not any action may be taken in response to a particular data processing condition based on policies . If workload manager determines that action will be taken in response to a particular data processing condition workload manager may implement such action based on policies . For example workload manager may respond to event based service request by implementing appropriate policy based provisioning of data processing resources as needed to respond to a detected data processing condition.

Workload manager also may respond to event based service request by generating service fulfillment response . For example service fulfillment response may be generated by workload manager and delivered to service desk ticketing function . Service fulfillment response may indicate that event based service request has been received by workload manager . Service fulfillment response also may indicate that appropriate action has been taken or will be taken in response to event based service request . In this case service fulfillment response may or may not specify the particular action taken or to be taken by workload manager in response to event based service request . In some cases workload manager may not be able to take action to change data processing conditions in response to event based service request . For example policies may prevent workload manager from taking action in response to event based service request at a particular time. In this case service fulfillment response may indicate that action will not be taken by workload manager in response to event based service request or that the implementation of such action may be delayed. Policies responsible for such a failure to act or for such a delay may or may not be identified in service fulfillment response .

The information provided by event based service request and service fulfillment response may be formatted appropriately and displayed for a user on monitoring station . By displaying information from event based service request and service fulfillment response in this manner a user is able to monitor the detection of data processing system conditions for which an appropriate action may be taken and the response of workload manager to the detection of such conditions.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator makes it possible for workload manager to respond to determined data processing conditions of interest in consumer data processing resources in provider data processing resources or both. Furthermore hybrid cloud integrator makes it possible for workload manager to access consumer data processing resources provider data processing resources or both for responding to determined conditions of interest. Thus hybrid cloud integrator makes it possible for workload manager to provide integrated data processing resource management across hybrid cloud by providing for monitoring of data processing conditions across hybrid cloud and by providing access to data processing resources across hybrid cloud when responding to such conditions.

For example as discussed above hybrid cloud integrator may be used to establish monitoring of the processing of portions of consumer workload by provider data processing resources while processing of other portions of consumer workload by consumer data processing resources also is monitored at the same time. Based on such monitoring an overload condition or underutilization condition on consumer data processing resources on provider data processing resources or both may be determined. In response to such a determination workload manager may activate or deactivate selected consumer data processing resources may deploy or release selected provider data processing resources using hybrid cloud integrator in the manner described above or both. Processing of portions of consumer workload then may be allocated by workload manager across the reconfigured resources of hybrid cloud to remedy the determined overload or underutilization condition. The particular action taken by workload manager in response to the determined condition may be determined by policies .
