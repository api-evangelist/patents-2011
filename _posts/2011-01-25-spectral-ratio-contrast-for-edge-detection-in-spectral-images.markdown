Image segmentation is one of the most important and difficult tasks in digital image processing and image analysis. It represents a key stage of automated image analysis and interpretation. Segmentation algorithms for gray scale images utilize basic properties of intensity values such as discontinuity and similarity. Detection of discontinuities in gray scale images is typically based on spatial masks whose response at any pixel in the image can be thought of as a finite difference approximation of a differential operator. A mask which can be used in a typical spatial feature extraction techniques and may also be referred to as kernel can be realized as a function that operates on pixel values in a predefined neighborhood M N of a pixel with spatial coordinates i j . Examples of some of the most popular gray scale edge detectors include Canny Sobel and Prewitt detectors. However it is possible to enhance edge detection capability by means of using spectral information provided by multispectral MS or hyperspectral HS imagery. A multi spectral imagery captures image data at specific frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum. Hyperspectral imagery captures image data from across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Transition from a gray scale to a multi color image complicates edge detection significantly. Standard definition of a gray scale edge as a ramp or ridge between two regions is no longer appropriate since a multi color image has multiple image planes one for each spectral band. More importantly depending upon the scene two distinct regions may exhibit the same intensity for one or more bands. In other words with respect to such iso luminant bands the edge between the two regions is characterized by a jump in color rather than intensity. Clearly iso luminant edges cannot be detected by a standard gradient operator. Extension of other gray scale processing techniques to multi colored images such as those based on differential operators faces similar difficulties.

Extension of differential edge detection to multi color images has followed two principal paths. A straightforward approach is to apply differential operators such as the gradient separately to each image plane and then somehow integrate this information to obtain edge and segmentation information. It has been previously pointed out that this can result in undesirable segmentation because information in separate channels is treated as independent whereas in actuality it is not. A second approach to multi color edge detection is to embed the variations of all color channels in a single measure which is then used to obtain the edge maps. Typically this approach is developed by starting from a given gray scale operator which is then extended consistently to multi color images. By consistently it is mean that the extended multi color operator reduces to its original gray scale prototype when applied to a single color image. Two representative examples of this approach are the multi color gradient MCG and the morphological color gradient MoCG . While multi color gradient and related ideas have been used with great success computation of the multi color gradient for multi color images with large numbers of bands can be quite expensive.

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings that show by way of illustration and not limitation various example embodiments of the invention. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice these and other embodiments. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural logical and electrical changes may be made to these embodiments. The various embodiments are not necessarily mutually exclusive as some embodiments can be combined with one or more other embodiments to form new embodiments. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense.

For multi color MS or HS images such an image is a three dimensional array of real numbers also called an image hypercube 111 1 For fixed i and j the k dimensional vector u i j u i j . . . u i j is called hyper pixel. The indices i and j denote the spatial position of the hyper pixel within a Focal Plane Array FPA and k is the band number. The value of u i j is referred to as the intensity of the k th band. Alternatively for a fixed k the two dimensional array u i j is the k th image plane or color slice of the multi color image. For MS images the number of bands K is typically between 10 and 15. For hyperspectral images K can be as high as several hundred bands.

In various embodiments image segmentation algorithms for multi color images with an emphasis on detection of multi color edges can be provided. In an example embodiment an algorithm for joint spatio spectral JSS feature selection can be implemented. By joint it is meant that spatial and spectral characteristics of a given multispectral MS or hyperspectral HS image are simultaneously taken into consideration. JSS feature selection can offer unique opportunities for image processing and remote sensing as it enables taking advantage of the correlation between spatial and spectral features.

Spectral ratio signatures can be used in an approach for JSS based edge detection termed spectral ratio contrast SRC edge detection algorithm. The SRC can be verified using MS and HS imagery from a quantum dot in a well DWELL infrared IR focal plane array FPA and the Airborne Hyperspectral Imager AHI respectively. The DWELL FPA is a special type MS imager characterized by the unique property that its spectral bands are selected electrically by altering the applied bias as shown in .

In an example embodiment spectral ratio contrast namely band ratios can be used to define an edge signature for an edge between two materials. The edge signature provides an index. The edge signature represents an optimized combination of spectral ratios calculated using bands that enhance the spectral contrast between the two materials. In conjunction with a spatial mask the edge signatures give rise to a multispectral operator that can be viewed as non separable with respect to the spectral and spatial domains three dimensional extension of the spatial mask. In the extended mask the third spectral dimension of each hyper pixel can be chosen independently. Such a mask does not operate in a single image plane but instead fuses information from multiple planes. shows an example of a non separable spatio spectral mask.

In an example embodiment a SRC approach can include two stages. The first stage can be implemented as a training stage which identifies the bands that maximize the spectral contrast between two given materials. A small subset of ratios that can reliably discriminate the edge between two materials from other spatial features is selected. Such a subset can be referred to as a spectral ratio index or signature of the edge. In order to extract spatial features such as edges the edge signatures can be combined with a suitable spatial mask to obtain a joint spatio spectral SRC mask. Obtaining the joint spatio spectral SRC mask provides a second stage of SRC that is the second stage provides a feature extraction step using the three dimensional mask defined by the bands selected at the training stage. Note that in SRC a spatial mask is used in a fundamentally different manner from the standard use of a mask as used in the context of gray scale images. Whereas in gray scale edge detection the response is single valued in SRC the response is multi valued returning the ratios of suitably defined pixel pairs from that structuring element. Starting from a given spatial mask a JSS SRC mask can be defined by retaining the spatial domain of the former and redefining its action in terms of spectral ratios corresponding to the bands from a given edge signature.

The presence of two stages in SRC provides an important distinction from the MCG based edge detection and other unsupervised edge detection algorithms. A second difference arises from the fact that SRC is not derivative based i.e. in SRC edge detection is effected by matching a given edge signature rather than by measuring the gradient magnitude. Because the edge signatures and the associated tolerance values are determined independently for each pair of classes of materials the edge extraction depends only on the quality of the selection criteria used to obtain the edge signature for a given pair and not on the strength of the edge as measured by its MCG value. As a result the SRC approach is particularly well suited to situations where the edge between two given materials is weak as measured by its MCG value.

In various embodiments application of spectral ratios to define MS and HS operators for edge detection can be implemented. Besides the potential for significant data compression in HS and MS image processing spectral ratios appear to be particularly well suited for intelligent sensing modalities using a spectrally tunable sensor such as the electrically tunable DWELL FPA. For example a training stage in a SRC approach can extract information about the most informative with respect to edge detection bias voltages bands in the sensed image. Image acquisition for a scene can then be carried out using only the relevant biases thereby significantly reducing the amount of data necessary for the image segmentation.

In various embodiments spectral ratio contrast i.e. band ratios can be used to define an edge signature index for an edge between two materials. The edge signature represents a combination of spectral ratios calculated using bands that enhance the spectral contrast between the two materials. In conjunction with a spatial mask the edge signatures give rise to a multispectral operator that can be viewed as a three dimensional extension of the spatial mask as shown in . In the extended mask the third spectral dimension of each hyper pixel can be chosen independently. Such a mask does not operate in a single image plane but instead fuses information from multiple planes.

Consider the following development of an example joint spatio spectral SRC spectral ratio contrast approach for edge detection in MS and HS images. Given two distinct materials A and B a unique signature for the edge Ebetween A and B can be created using the spectral ratios of their hyper pixels. In other words those bands from A and B whose ratios can best discriminate Efrom the rest of the spatial features in the scene are sought.

Ecan be defined as the set of hyper pixels on the boundary between A and B. Thus pixels belonging to Eare characterized by the existence of small neighborhoods containing elements from both A and B. Let and 2 denote the representative hyper pixels of A and B respectively. For example a and b may correspond to the class means determined from a training set. In what follows given a vector c R the following notation can be used 11 . . . 1 . 3 The spectral ratio index between A and B can be defined as the following K K matrix 

An SRC approach can include a step to identify a small subset of S ratios from the above K K matrix S

In order to extract spatial features such as edges the edge signatures must be combined with a suitable spatial mask to obtain a joint spatio spectral SRC mask this provides a second step of an SRC approach. As in standard gray scale image processing the purpose of this mask is to compute the image response to a spatial structuring element. However in SRC the spatial mask is used in a fundamentally different manner. Whereas in gray scale edge detection the response is single valued and represents a weighted average of the intensity values of the pixels in the structuring element in SRC the response is multi valued and returns the ratios of suitably defined pixel pairs from that structuring element.

In the SRC mask the band indices play the role of weights and summation of pixel intensities can be replaced by their division according to a pair of band indices. Therefore starting from a given spatial mask a joint spatio spectral SRC mask can defined by retaining the spatial domain of the former and redefining its action in terms of spectral ratios corresponding to the bands from a given edge signature.

To illustrate the process of converting a spatial mask into a SRC mask consider a gray scale mask M whose response on a gray scale image u is defined by the formula

To define the response of the joint spatio spectral SRC mask the weights in M i j can be discarded and the pixel pairs in M can be combined with the band indices from a given edge signature . The result is a mapping K 10 from the three dimensional MS or HS image cube with spatial dimensions I J and a spectral dimension K into a smaller hypercube with the same spatial dimensions I J but with a reduced spectral dimension MS

At every spatial location i j the response of Kcan be viewed as an M S matrix of spectral ratios given by

Khas a joint spatio spectral character. As another example of the joint spatio spectral character of K consider an example in which the spatial mask comprises the first two pairs in equation 9 and the edge signature has length 1 i.e. a case where M 2 and S 1. Therefore at every spatial location i j the response K i j is a 2 1 matrix. Computation of the row elements in this matrix is illustrated schematically in . This figure clearly shows that unlike a conventional mask Kdoes not operate in a single image plane but instead fuses information from multiple planes and is not separable into spectral and spatial components. The spectral plane for each element in Kis selected through the edge signature i.e. the indices p q in a way that enhances that feature.

In the following an example formulation of the training and feature extraction stages of the SRC approach where the manner in which Kcan be used to discriminate the edges between A and B is provided. For clarity selection criteria used to determine the edge signature equation 5 are presented separately from the algorithm description.

For implementation of a SRC algorithm consider for simplicity a SRC approach assuming two distinct materials A and B. The example algorithm has two stages 1 a training step where the appropriate edge signatures can be determined and the associated three dimensional SRC mask can be defined and 2 a feature extraction step where the response of this SRC mask on a given MS or HS image is used to effect the spatial feature extraction.

In the training stage three key components include 1 selection of representative training data sets for materials A and B 2 defining a selection criteria for determining the edge signature equation 5 and 3 selection of a spatial mask M used to define the SRC mask in equation 11 . The second step is essential for the success of the SRC approach.

The training stage can proceed as follows. Let 1 13 and 1 14 denote the training sets for classes A and B respectively where I A J A I B and J B are index sets that define the training samples. Using the training data the class means Rand Rcan be computed according to

After completing the training stage the feature extraction stage can be performed. At this step Kcan be applied to a given multispectral image u R. For each hyper pixel u i j located at position i j with respect to the FPA the stage can proceed as follows. First the M S ratios giving the response K i j at u i j can be computed as defined in equation 11 . Recalling that M denotes the number of the distinct pixels pairs involved in the calculation of K i j and S is the length of i.e. the number of ratios used to discriminate the edge between A and B.

The response calculated ratios of the SRC mask at a given hyper pixel u i j can then be used as an input to form an indicator matrix

If the hyper pixel pair u i j u i j belongs to the same material type then the test in equation 18 will force most if not all elements in the m th row of i j to zero. Conversely if the hyper pixels forming the pair are from the two different materials either K i j s or its reciprocal K i j s will be close to the ratio pfrom the edge signature . As a result the above test will set most if not all of the elements s in the m th row of i j to one.

In summary for a given pixel pair u i j u i j the number of non zeros in the associated m th row of the indicator matrix reveals the number of times the response of the SRC mask K i j has matched to within the specified tolerance the spectral ratios from the edge signature . Because the pixel pairs used to form the response K i j correspond to different edge orientations e.g. horizontal vertical or diagonal the number of ones in each row indicates the strength of the particular edge direction at position i j.

The information contained in the rows of i j can be used to define an edge map F RR i.e. a mapping that assigns the value 1 to pixel location i j if u i j belongs to an edge E and 0 otherwise as follows u i j can be classified as belonging to Eif the edge strength in at least one direction as measured by the number of ones in the rows of i j exceeds a specified integer tolerance value tilde over S 

This criterion can be conveniently expressed in terms of the matrix infinity norm. For a given matrix A Rthe infinity norm M is defined as the maximum absolute row sum of M 

The value of the integer parameter tilde over S can be used to adjust the sensitivity of the feature extraction step to e.g. noise. For example increasing tilde over S makes the algorithm less sensitive to noise but more restrictive. Conversely decreasing S makes the algorithm less restrictive but more sensitive to noise. A similar effect can be achieved by setting tilde over S S and increasing or decreasing the number of ratios in the edge signature .

Extension of the above approach to three or more materials is straightforward. For the case of three distinct materials A B and C there are three possible edge classes between A and B between A and C and between B and C. Accordingly at the training stage three edge signatures and three tolerance values and and three joint spatio spectral masks K K and Kcan be defined.

At the feature extraction stage the responses of K K and Kcan be used to identify the hyper pixels belonging to edge Ebetween A and B edge Ebetween A and C and edge Ebetween B and C. The final image segmentation is obtained by the union of the three edges 21 The training and testing phases of the SRC algorithm are shown schematically in respectively. Because the edge signatures and the associated tolerance values are determined independently for each pair of classes the feature extraction depends only on the quality of the selection criteria used to obtain the edge signature for this pair and not on the strength of the edge as measured by its MCG value. As a result the SRC approach is particularly well suited to situations where the edge between two given materials is weak as measured by its MCG value compared to the edges between the other materials in the scene. For scenes that contain both weak and strong edges as measured by their MCG gradients an MCG based feature extraction would require sophisticated locally adaptive threshold strategies to capture the weak edges. If a single non adaptive threshold is used in order for MCG to pick the weak edges one has to increase the tolerance to a point where the noise level may become unacceptable.

The processing complexity of the SRC algorithm can be estimated by an estimate of the complexity of the feature extraction stage in the SRC algorithm since the training stage is not included in the SRC complexity estimate because it is usually done off line before the actual image processing commences. Consider an HS or an MS image given by a hypercube with dimensions I J K. Recall that I J is the dimension of the image plane whereas K is the number of spectral bands which ranges from tens for MS images to hundreds for HS images.

The cost of the feature extraction stage of SRC includes 1 the cost to compute the response K i j of the SRC mask at every pixel including the reciprocal ratios K i j s needed in equation 18 2 the cost to form the indicator matrix 5.12 and 3 the cost to compute the edge map according to equation 20 . From these three steps the first one is the costliest as it involves floating point arithmetic. The second and the third steps require mostly integer arithmetic and logical operations that are faster than floating point arithmetic. Nonetheless for simplicity in the cost estimate all operations can be counted as being the same without regard to the fact that some of them take less CPU time to execute.

Computation of the response K i j at a single pixel including the computation of the reciprocal ratios takes 2MS operations. Thus the total operation count for Step 1 is 2 I J MS. Forming the indicator matrix at Step 2 is based on equation 18 and requires at most four comparisons. Therefore the cost of forming a single entry of i j is 4 operations the cost of forming i j is 4MS and the cost of forming i j for all pixels is 4 I J MS.

Finally Step 3 requires computation of the matrix infinity norm of i j for every pixel location i j. Recall that the matrix infinity norm is the maximum absolute row sum of the matrix. Summing up the elements in a single row of i j takes S 1 operations and so computation of all row sums requires M S 1 operations. In the worst case scenario finding the largest of these sums takes M 1 comparisons. It follows that the per pixel cost of Step 3 is M M 1 S 1 operations and the total cost of this step is I J M M 1 S 1 .

An edge signature can be formed as a pairwise ratio edge index. In this section a strategy is described in which the selection of the spectral ratios forming the edge signature is restricted to the diagonal elements of the spectral ratio index A B defined in equation 4 . These ratios correspond to spectral bands with the same numbers thus the term pairwise ratios .

To motivate this strategy note that in the ideal case the spectral ratio index A A for two identical materials has diagonal elements equal to one. Therefore hyper pixels from the same class will have nearly constant pairwise ratios close to 1 while hyper pixels from different classes will have at least some of their pairwise ratios away from 1.

Variability of pairwise band ratios can play the same role for multi color images as gray scale discontinuity and similarity for gray scale images. The objective is to define the pairwise ratio edge signatures using a small number of ratios S

One fairly straightforward approach that performs well in practice is to use the maximum and the minimum pairwise ratios i.e. set 22 where kand kare the band indices corresponding to the minimum and maximum diagonal elements of A B respectively. Note that for consistency with the notation in equation 5 both bands forming the ratio are stated explicitly even though they are the same.

The associated tolerances can be determined in several different ways. A good estimate can be obtained by computing the spread of the min and max ratios for the training data. For example set

A 2 band pairwise min max signature may provide the simplest possible signatures that capture the relevant variation in the band ratios. More complex pairwise signatures can be created by including additional band ratios in a recursive manner as follows. Starting from a basic 2 band min max signature a 3 band signature can obtained by adding the band corresponding to the next maximum ratio. Alternatively a 4 band signature can be obtained by adding 2 bands for the next maximum and minimum ratios or another 3 band signature by adding the band for the next minimum ratio. This process can be repeated until a satisfactory signature is obtained. Also sensitivity to noise can be further reduced by increasing the number of pairwise band ratios in the signature i.e. the number S in equation 20 .

Because the choice of ratios in the pairwise strategy is limited to the diagonal elements of the spectral ratio index A B in equation 4 it is clear that in some cases this strategy may not perform as well as a more general strategy that allows one to choose from all possible ratio combinations in A B. For example if two materials have hyper pixels that are translations of each other i.e. differ by a constant intensity factor then the pairwise strategy will fail if the data is normalized. Likewise a weak edge will have pairwise ratio close to one and so its pairwise signature will be close to that of identical materials. Consequently the pairwise approach will tend to miss weak edges.

An alternative ratio selection strategy that is not restricted to the diagonal elements of A B can be realized by a cross ratio edge index. In a general cross ratio strategy for determining the edge signature e the bands for each ratio can be selected in a two step process and may be different thus the term cross ratio. The key distinction between the cross ratio approach and the pairwise approach in the last section is that now the choice of the ratios in the edge signature is not limited to the diagonal elements of the spectral contrast matrix

A two step procedure can be implemented that gives rise to edge signatures that enhance weak edges. Assume two materials A and B with representative hyper pixels a and b respectively. Let 1

The first step in this strategy is to select the S bands where the classes A and B have maximum separation. Given representative hyper pixels and for A and B respectively set

At the second step can be defined by selecting ratios that exhibit the strongest spectral contrast between the classes. To rank the ratios according to their spectral contrast it is noted that owing to the assumption that all p 1 the ratios closest to zero correspond to the strongest spectral contrast between any two bands. Thus the first pair of bands p q can be selected as the pair corresponding to the smallest ratio 

As an example of the implementation of a joint spatio spectral mask K consider the fusing of the edge signature with a specific spatial mask M. For simplicity consider the 3 3 spatial mask M shown in . Recall that for this mask M 4 i.e. M has four distinct pixel pairs given by equation 9 . Let be an edge signature with length S 0. Using Ein conjunction with the mask M yields a joint spatio spectral mask K 33 whose response at a hyper pixel u i j is given by the 4 S matrix

Definition of equation 33 can be easily modified by adding or removing pixel pairs. For example a simpler definition of Kresults from using only the first two pixel pairs u i j u i j and u i j u i j from M. In this case M 2 K RRand the response of Kat a hyper pixel u i j is given by the 2 S matrix

In various implementations by choosing bands with maximum separation and allowing unrestricted band combinations to form the ratios edge signatures can be defined with the minimal possible length which perform as well as the longer edge signatures whose ratios are restricted to the diagonal of the spectral contrast matrix. This is an important result because it enables potentially significant data compression with minimal loss of the ability to extract the spatial features.

In various embodiments a joint spatio spectral approach can be implemented for image segmentation of MS and HS images. The SRC algorithm differs from the existing edge detection methodologies for such images in several important ways. Unlike the multi color gradient MCG or the morphological color gradient MoCG approaches the SRC algorithm is not an extension of an existing gray scale processing methodology instead it is designed from the onset as a dedicated MS HS edge detection algorithm. In particular the SRC algorithm fuses a given spatial mask with the spectral band ratios from a given edge signature into a non separable three dimensional spatio spectral mask.

Another equally important distinction is that an SRC approach utilizes the concept of the spectral ratio contrast to estimate similarity and discontinuity in a given HS MS image rather than measuring the rate of change in the image as in the MCG and MoCG algorithms. Among other things by requiring only a few bands per edge signature the use of spectral ratios in the SRC enables unprecedented levels of data compression at the feature extraction stage. This aspect of the SRC approach is particularly attractive for HS images for which the number of bands can be as high as several hundred. Another distinction between the SRC technique and other approaches is that the SRC technique is a two stage procedure comprising a training phase and a feature extraction phase.
